The text you provided is discussing the current situation with Wuhan coronavirus (WN-CoV). 

1. The text notes that the Department for Health Science and Security (DHSC) has recently provided an update on the current declared cases, deaths and geographic spread.

2. The text also notes that China has recently revised case definitions. This makes comparisons difficult.

3. The text then provides information about diagnostic testing capability in Wuhan being overwhelmed. 

4. The text then goes on to note that the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has just published "Risk assessment guidelines for infectious diseases transmitted on aircraft  (RAGIDA) - Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV)). 

5. The text then provides information about ECDC advising use of MERS guidelines for the current outbreak, but acknowledging the limitations of its evidence base.

6. The text then goes on to note that the UK currently has good centralised diagnostic capacity for WN-CoV  -- and is days away from a specific test, which is scalable across the UK in weeks.

7. The text then provides information about the sensitivity of the test being currently unknown.

Overall, the text appears to be discussing the current situation with Wuhan coronavirus (WN-CoV).


Summary of actions:
1. CMO to share the latest iteration of the PHE isolation plan for suspected cases and contacts with some of the SAGE participants, in particular behavioural scientists, to get their view of its proportionality and advice on how unconnected to Wuhan to communicate uncertainty.
2. CMO/DHSC and PHE to consider how NHS primary care facilities might respond to an increase of cases and potential cases.
3. CMOIDHSC and FCO to work together to ensure consistent messaging on travel advice to/from Wuhan.
