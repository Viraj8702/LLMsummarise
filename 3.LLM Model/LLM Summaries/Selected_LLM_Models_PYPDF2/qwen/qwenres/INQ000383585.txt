The summary is that Chris, the CMO, is leading a call with directors of public health in England to discuss current epidemiology of the outbreak, two scenarios and how there is the potential for a situation in which we would move from containment to mitigation (but this is not the case now).

In the call, the following topics were discussed:

  * The current epidemiology of the outbreak.
  * Two possible scenarios: a mild scenario and a severe scenario.
  * How there is the potential for a situation in which we would move from containment to mitigation (but this is not the case now)).
