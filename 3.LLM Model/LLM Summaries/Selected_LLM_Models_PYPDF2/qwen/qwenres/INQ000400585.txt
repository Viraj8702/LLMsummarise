Yes, that is correct. The number of cases and deaths from COVID-19 continue to grow around the world. This growth in cases and deaths from COVID-19 can impact various sectors such as healthcare, education, finance, tourism etc. Therefore it is crucial to monitor and control the spread of COVID-19.

The text provides data related to COVID-19 inpatient trends, which are very similar to those for the COVID-19 case admissions. The highest number of COVID-19 intensive care inpatients was in April 2020 and January 2021 at approximately 100 intensive care inpatient cases on a single day. There was a large decrease in intensive care COVID-19 inpatients between Wave 2 and subsequent waves and numbers have generally been on a decreasing trend since November 2021
