Title: INQ000385719 - Email chain between Rob Orford (Chief Scientific Adviser for Health, Welsh Government), Frank Atherton (Chief Medical Officer for Wales), Tracey Cooper (Chief Executive of Public Health Wales) and colleagues, regarding PHW/WG - National assessment, dated between 10/11/2020 and 11/10/2020.

Dear All,
I have prepared a high-level points guide that will provide us with some context and direction for the meeting.
2. What does global experience suggest?
- Countries that have gone for suppression followed by intent to eliminate have 3 key factors in their success:
a) Very stringent border control to keep imported infections to a lowest possible effect.
b) Stopping all non-essential travel to prevent further spread of infections.
c) Strict enforcement of returning traveler quarantining and evidencing it to ensure that no further spread of infections is caused by those returning from abroad.

d) Financial incentives for people needing to isolate to encourage them to follow the instructions provided to them by their public health authorities or medical practitioners.
These three factors have played a key role in enabling many countries around the world to successfully control and eliminate the COVID-19 pandemic.
3. What options do we have and when do we enact them?

A. Continuing with current approach:

o Local and hyper-local lockdowns, such as those implemented by some of the largest cities across the United States, will soon become ineffective.

o In response to the rapid increase in new cases of COVID-19 reported by many countries around the world, including many of the largest cities across the United States, governments have been forced to take emergency actions, including issuing lockdown orders and implementing other measures to try to control and eliminate the COVID-19 pandemic.
B. Going for additional national interventions:

o What are those? When do we enact them?

A. Interventions related to supply chain management:

* Establishing global coordination mechanisms, such as the Global Health Intelligence Network (GHIN) established by the World Health Organization (WHO), and leveraging these mechanisms to coordinate and facilitate the development of global supply chains for the manufacture and distribution of medical supplies, including personal protective equipment (PPE), ventilators, test kits, etc., in response to the rapid increase in new cases of COVID-19 reported by many countries around the world, including many of the largest cities across the United States.
