Title: INQ000396685 - Paper from the Welsh Government titled Information Management and Governance Policy, dated February 2019

The Welsh Government Information Management and Governance Policy sets out the commitment of the Welsh Government to manage information in a professional manner. The policy also sets out the roles and responsibilities for creating, safekeeping, assurance, use, storage, access, share, and publishing records. The policy is supported by a framework of more detailed data, information, and records, and security policies. The Welsh Government uses an eight stage Information Lifecycle: Create, Assure, Use, Store, Access, Share, and publish and dispose.


The Welsh Government's Information Security policy sets out an approach to ensure that the organisation's information assets are properly protected against a variety of threats.

The SIRO Risk Appetite Statement defines at a practical level how the Welsh Government protects its information assets.

The Welsh Government uses systems (including manual systems) to create, store or process information. The management of these systems is considered as corporate resources.

Privacy by Design holds that organisations need to consider privacy at the initial design stages and throughout the complete development process of new products, processes or services that involve processing personal data.


Our policy is to: 

1. Manage all business information as a shared resource within the Welsh Government, with access only limited when there are security, privacy or sensitivity requirements.

2. Send iShare links internally rather than reproducing or sending attachments in emails.

3. Where possible, use iShare Connect, Egress, etc. when sharing information with colleagues outside the Welsh Government.

4. Ensure that documents shared with third parties do not contain comments, tracked changes, or similar "hidden" content.

Our policy is to ensure that all business information is managed as a shared resource within the Welsh Government, with access only limited when there are security, privacy or sensitivity requirements.

 Welsh Government use? The Welsh Government adopted the HMG Security Classification Policy for all records created from April 2014.

Historical files retain the classification system that was in place when they were created in order to preserve the administrative history and context of those files. NB - 'Lock down' or password protection of Word documents. No Welsh Government documents should be locked down or password protected. It restricts the document'


as they are managed under different guidelines. It is important that these guidelines are clearly communicated to all relevant parties within an inheriting function as appropriate.

It is vital that records created by Private Offices and the Office of the Permanent Secretary are managed in accordance with the Public Records Act. This includes ensuring that sensitive information is only included in encrypted emails or those sent to a secure email address 6.

The Cabinet Office has issued guidance to government on dealing with Private Email Use which includes guidance relating to the Freedom of Information Act.


In summary, Special Advisers with wider roles within the Welsh Government require separate consideration. If their records only mirror those existing elsewhere in the Welsh Government there is no reason for them to be kept as part of the official record. In most cases, the retention period will be around 3 years following the end of the operation.


Records created in the course of collaborative working or through out-sourcing require specific management measures.

Firstly, these records should be kept for a reasonable period of time after completion of the collaborative work or outsourcing. This period of time should be determined based on the nature and complexity of the collaborative work or outsourcing. Additionally, this period of time should be determined based on the likelihood and potential impact of any errors or issues that may arise during the course of the collaborative work or outsourcing.

Secondly, these records should be maintained in a secure manner. This means that the records should be stored in secure locations such as password-protected servers or hard drives that are protected by physical security measures such as locks on doors or cabinets. Additionally, the records should be protected against unauthorized access by implementing appropriate security measures such as firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and access control lists.

Thirdly, these records should be protected against accidental loss, destruction or damage by implementing appropriate technical or organisational measures such as backup procedures, disaster recovery plans, and regular maintenance and inspection of the records.


The text provides guidelines for managing changes in machinery of government/transfer of functions. The guidelines include steps such as informing the Departmental Records Officer at the earliest opportunity, involving the Departmental Records Officer throughout the process to ensure that correct information and records procedures are followed and legislation met, and documenting all decisions on the legal status, movement, disposal and destruction of information in an official Transfer Agreement signed by both the transferring and receiving organization.


Transfer of information must be done formally as it is a transfer of information between two separate legal entities.
Public Inquiries investigate issues of serious public concern and establish the facts of past decisions and events.

It is important that Public Inquiries are accountable for how they receive evidence, gather information, deliberate and report their findings.

A Public Inquiry must maintain an adequate record to:

• Demonstrate the conduct of the Inquiry and provide accountability for its findings

• Ensure that the Inquiry Panel and associated staff can access and retrieve information when required

• Secure records of historical/ research value


Legal discovery refers to the process through which a party in a legal dispute compiles information and evidence relevant to its case.

Candor, on the other hand, is a principle of ethics that requires individuals or groups to be truthful about their actions, intentions, and beliefs.

In the context of legal discovery, the duty of candor means that parties involved in legal disputes must be truthful and transparent about their information, evidence, and actions relevant to their cases.

According to the Public Records Act 1958 and the Freedom of Information Act 2000 (Section 46), the Welsh Government was required to dispose of or transfer all records to a Place of Deposit by the time they reached thirty years old (known as the 30 Year Rule) so that they could be made available to the public.
