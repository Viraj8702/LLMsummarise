Title: INQ000350691 - Statement by Jane Hutt (Deputy First Minister) and Welsh Government, titled Statement to mark the International Day of Disabled People, dated 01/12/2020.

The Welsh Government issued a statement on December 1st, marking the United Nations International Day of Disabled People. Since 1992, the UN has designated December 3rd as a day to promote the rights and well-being of disabled people and celebrate their achievements worldwide. This year's theme is 'Building Back Better: towards a disability inclusive, accessible, and sustainable post-COVID world.' The pandemic has highlighted existing problems in society that have become more obvious, such as isolation, disconnect, disrupted routines, and diminished services which greatly impact the lives and mental wellbeing of many disabled people. In Wales, from March to July 68% (almost 7 out of every 10) Covid-related deaths were from the disabled community, with a higher death rate among those with learning disabilities. The Welsh Government has adopted the Social Model of Disability since 2002, which recognizes that people with impairments are disabled by society's actions, not their impairments. Deputy Minister Jane Hutt MS and Chief Whip will focus on addressing disablism directly and ensuring this approach is built into all policies across the Senedd’s work. The Welsh Government also supports a new fund for disabled people to seek elected office in 2021 Senedd elections and 2022 Local Government elections, aiming to reduce barriers preventing individuals from participating in local democracy.


In Wales, new Disability Employment Champions will be introduced to support employers and create a more representative and inclusive workforce. A practical guide called 'A More Equal Wales: A Practical Guide for Employers employing Disabled People' will help employers make their workplaces disability-friendly. This guide was launched on the International Day of Disabled People. During the pandemic, representatives from Disability Equality Forum provided valuable insights into how disabled people were affected by the virus and suggested ways to improve access to information during this time. 

To address the economic impact of COVID-19 on third sector organizations that support disabled individuals, £200,000 from the Welsh Government's Reserves for Reconstruction package has been allocated for disability projects across Wales. This funding will be distributed as small grants to nine Disabled People's Organizations in order to provide crucial information and advice while also developing new responses to COVID-19 needs of disabled people. A report on the impact of COVID-19 on disabled individuals, led by Professor Debbie Foster from Cardiff University, is also being produced with input from members of the Disability Equality Forum. The aim of this project is to inform a refresh of the 2019 'Action on Disability' framework so that lessons learned during the pandemic can be implemented quickly.


On the International Day of Disabled People, disabled individuals in Wales celebrated their contributions to society as recognized by the United Nations. The event highlighted efforts towards inclusivity and equality for people with disabilities within communities across the country.
