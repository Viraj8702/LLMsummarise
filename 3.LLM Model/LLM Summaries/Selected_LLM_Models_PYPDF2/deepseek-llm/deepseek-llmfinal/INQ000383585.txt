Title: INQ000383585 - Email from DHSC colleague to Sir Frank Atherton (Chief Medical Officer for Wales), Professor Chris Whitty (Chief Medical Officer for England), Catherine Calderwood (Chief Medical Officer for Northern Ireland) and Michael McBride (Chief Medical Officer for Nothern Ireland) regarding CMO Coronavirus briefing for DsPH, dated 05/02/2020.

On January 31, 2020, a CMO coronavirus briefing was held for Directors of Public Health. The Chief Medical Officer (CMO) outlined the current epidemiology of the outbreak and described two scenarios, including the potential to move from containment to mitigation. However, this is not the case currently, and they are using pandemic flu as a reasonable worst-case scenario for planning purposes.

During Q&A, the CMO confirmed that the pandemic flu model was being used for the time being. They also noted that they do not yet know if surviving infection protects against re-infection. The NERVTAG will issue advice on treatment options, which are currently being considered. Additionally, planning for mitigation is wise at this time.

The CMO updated participants about a plane bringing people back from China and changes to geographical case definition and clinical case definition. The Deputy Chief Medical Officer (DCMO) took over as Chair during the call. During Q&A, DCMO agreed to communicate with Comms colleagues that the detail of comms must be appropriate for the listening environment. They also addressed specific requests from the North East about information on quarantine and better centrally led comms in relation to housing repatriated individuals in the Wirral and choice of location.

Lastly, the DCMO committed to share information imparted during the call with participants via email and flagged a follow-up call with DHSC colleagues regarding housing issues. The Head of Office to the Chief Medical Officer sent an email summarizing the briefing, which was not intended for unauthorized use or disclosure. Any views expressed in this message may not necessarily represent those of the Department of Health and Social Care.
