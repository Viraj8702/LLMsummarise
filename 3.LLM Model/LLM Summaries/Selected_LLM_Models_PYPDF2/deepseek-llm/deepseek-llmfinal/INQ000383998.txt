Title: INQ000383998 - Email chain between Dr Rob Orford (Chief Scientific Adviser for Health, Welsh Government), PS Minister of Health and Social Services and colleagues, regarding Welsh National COVID 19 Test Plan, dated 27/03/2020.

The Minister has approved a plan for COVID-19 testing in Wales, but has questions about its implementation. The plan involves procuring equipment such as four Starlet machines and six Nimbus platforms, delivering testing reagents by a certain date, and increasing daily test capacity by a certain date. It does not depend on UK initiatives from Boots or Amazon. The plan also involves exploring additional options with universities and other pharma companies to increase capacity further. Positive data links are highlighted in the plan, which should be shared with other nations in the fight against COVID-19.
