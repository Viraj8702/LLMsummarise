Title: INQ000395589 - Email chain between Gill Richardson (Professional Advisor to the Chief Medical Officer, Welsh Government) and Welsh Government and Public Health Wales colleagues, regarding a DHSC/PHE/DA call, dated between 14/04/2020 and 15/04/2020.

The text discusses the need for a handle on healthcare worker (HCW) deaths and shares information about oxygen issues in mental health trusts in England. The writer mentions that they met with the Minister where they agreed not to report HCW deaths in Wales, due to lower numbers compared to other areas. The Public Health Wales is not reporting overall deaths in local authority areas, as in England; however, some Health Boards are reporting on staff deaths, and family members of deceased NHS staff may disclose details publicly. The writer also raises the issue of oxygen supplies, noting that interim 'clipper' supply is running but only to a limited number of people at present.


This message discusses a shortage of body bags, the distribution of 8,000 body bags today in England, and oxygen issues in some hospitals, particularly mental health trusts that rely on bottled cylinders. The message also mentions a social care action plan being published today by the Secretary of State, with focus on workforce problems and communication efforts. Antibody testing will be released today by Oxford University. Additionally, discussions about discrepancies between NHS England and ONS death data continue, with a new process for capturing deaths in healthcare workers and adult social care workers under review.


The text discusses various updates on COVID-19 response efforts, including data collection and release, infection control, workforce support, vulnerable groups, care home deaths, testing, antibody testing, LISA testing, population sampling, workforce numbers, professional interest in returning to work, clinical placements, demand for services, messaging with employers, recruitment drive for adult social care, and international collaboration. The Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) is working on an action plan to improve infections control, support the workforce, and assist vulnerable groups, which will be published tomorrow. There have been requests to include care home deaths in daily data but it's difficult to unpick this data. Testing numbers are down significantly, possibly reflecting increased capacity to bring on more staff. DHSC is keeping a close eye on the home care sector, which is under significant pressure due to staff absences and reduced support services. The department is also considering how to roll out LISA testing in parallel with antibody testing and ramping up population sampling options. There has been a good response to requests for help from industry, and workforce numbers are increasing, with professionals expressing an interest in returning to work and students getting ready for clinical placements. However, some areas may not be experiencing the increase in demand for services yet, so they are being encouraged to think mid-term rather than only short-term and take up the offer of available staff. The DHSC is also starting a recruitment drive into the adult social care sector in the next 48 hours. There have been no updates on international collaboration during the call.


The email from Dr. Anna Schwappach, a Public Health Wales Specialty Registrar and Public Health England Officer, discusses the ongoing efforts of their international public health team during the COVID-19 pandemic. The team is currently focusing on recruitment for various roles within the organization in preparation for new guidance related to funerals. Currently, there are shortages of ICU drugs and specific medications such as atracurium, which may cause a temporary issue with patient treatment. Despite these challenges, they continue their work while also acknowledging correspondence in Welsh and providing clear responses.
