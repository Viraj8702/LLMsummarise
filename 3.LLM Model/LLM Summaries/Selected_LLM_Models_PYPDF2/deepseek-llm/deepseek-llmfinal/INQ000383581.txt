Title: INQ000383581 - Minutes of Precautionary SAGE Meeting on Wuhan Coronavirus (WN-CoV) regarding situation update, current understanding of WN-CoV, NERVTAG conclusions, transport-related issues, UK health readiness and planning and HMG response, dated 23/01/2020.

The text provides an update on the Wuhan Coronavirus (WN-CoV) as of January 23, 2020, following a SAGE meeting. DHSC reports current declared cases, deaths, and geographic spread; however, comparisons with China's revised case definitions are difficult due to uncertainty surrounding data. Diagnostic testing capacity in Wuhan is overwhelmed, with likely many more reported cases than those confirmed. The World Health Organization (WHO) has received environmental sampling from Wuhan, and information on the zoonotic reservoir may be forthcoming shortly.

There is evidence of person-to-person transmission of WN-CoV, but its sustainability remains unknown. The incubation period for WN-CoV ranges between 5 to 10 days; however, a sensible outer limit to use is 14 days after contact. It is highly probable that the reproductive number of WN-CoV is currently above 1. Currently, it is estimated that the mortality rate for WN-CoV is lower than SARS, but reliable quantification remains too early.

No evidence indicates whether individuals are infectious before showing symptoms or if they're more infectious when symptoms are more severe. Genetic diversity within WN-CoV appears low, based on available sequences so far. Based on lessons from MERS and SARS, it is reasonable to argue that individuals returning from Wuhan without symptoms after 14 days pose no further risk.

NERVTAG does not advise port of entry screening or use of screening questionnaires, pilot declarations, or requiring confirmation of exit screening at Wuhan. However, NERVTAG supports public health information efforts via leaflets, posters, and broadcast messengers to passengers. SAGE agrees with this position but would review its stance on port screening only if a simple, specific, and rapid test was available and deployable across the UK.

The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has recommended using MERS guidelines for the current outbreak; however, it acknowledges limitations in their evidence base. The UK currently has good centralised diagnostic capacity for WN-CoV, with a specific test scalable across the country within weeks.


The UK government is developing advice for healthcare workers on testing individuals who may have been infected with the new coronavirus (WN-CoV). The sensitivity of diagnostic tests from upper respiratory tract sampling remains uncertain. Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE) has agreed that the criteria for testing potentially infected individuals, including those with symptoms or signs of WN-CoV and a history of traveling to or living in Wuhan within 14 days prior to symptom onset, are appropriate. SAGE recommends that the DHSC and PHE should be prepared to revise these criteria as the situation evolves.

DHSC and PHE are also preparing plans for isolating potentially infected individuals and following up with their contacts. The Chief Medical Officer (CMO) will share the latest iteration of the PHE isolation plan for suspected cases and contacts, including behavioural scientists, to seek feedback on proportionality and advice on communicating uncertainties in order to improve subsequent versions. CMO/DHSC and PHE will also consider how primary care facilities in the NHS can respond if there is an increase in cases or potential cases.

The UK government and its Foreign & Commonwealth Office (FCO) are working together to ensure consistent messaging regarding travel advice for/from Wuhan. There are currently no practical preventative actions that the government might undertake before Chinese New Year, but triggers exist within DHSC's current criteria, such as infection of healthcare workers and probably some sustained human-to-human transmission, with geographical spread not connected to China.

SAGE agreed that in case of onward spread of WN-CoV person-to-person outside of China or a severe confirmed case in the UK, the government should review its response. SAGE is unable to say at this stage whether reconvening might be required. Various participants from SAGE and secretariat are involved in observing and providing input into decision making processes.
