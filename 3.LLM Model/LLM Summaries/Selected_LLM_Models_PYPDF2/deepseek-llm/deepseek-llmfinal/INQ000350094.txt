Title: INQ000350094 - Emails between Lee Waters (Deputy Minister for Economy and Transport) and (Private Secretary Deputy Minister Economy and Transport, Welsh Government) regarding a review of post-firebreak restrictions, between 19/11/2020 and 15/12/2020.

The email discusses two different inquiries regarding non-essential items and leisure facility restrictions. In the first inquiry, the recipient is waiting for clarification on the sale of non-essential items in supermarkets in Tier 4, a COVID-19 restriction level. The second inquiry is about updating information on gyms in Tier 4 and gradations of supermarket restrictions across different levels.

In the first inquiry, it's mentioned that leisure and fitness facilities (gyms, swimming pools, spas, fitness studios) will be closed in Tier 4, but supermarkets will remain open at all levels as they are considered essential. The only restriction on supermarkets in Tier 4 could be the sale of non-essential items, for which the recipient is waiting for clarification.

In the second inquiry, there was an update on unlicensed music events. It was agreed to maintain a £10,000 fixed penalty option after ensuring access to justice concerns are met through clear communication with recipients of FPNs about their ability to reject it and argue in court (at risk of an unlimited fine). A new offence of failure to comply with Premises Improvement Notice terms will be created with an FPN starting at £1,000 on subsequent occasions. This action was taken in the regulations that came into force last Friday.

There is also a separate inquiry about leisure facility restrictions; however, no specific information is provided in this email.


This text appears to summarize a discussion between officials and government ministers regarding changes to fines and penalties related to various offenses, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic. The main points discussed are as follows:

1. Reduction of the fine for failing to self-isolate following international travel from a fixed £1000 to an initial £500 (rising on subsequent occasions). This will apply to the main offense and also to linked offenses such as obstructing an enforcement officer in pursuit of this offense. This change is being implemented in this week's international travel regulations that come into force on Saturday morning.

2. Increase of the fine for organizing an event of over 15 people indoors or over 30 people outdoors (house party offense) from an initial £200 to an initial £500 (rising on subsequent occasions). This change will be included in next week's regulations introducing the "traffic lights" system. Communications are working on materials to announce the increase and emphasize the importance of not holding parties.

3. Reduction of the fine for international travel operators failing to give information to travelers from a fixed £4000 to an initial £1000, rising on subsequent occasions. This change is being implemented in this week's international travel regulations that come into force on Saturday morning.

6. Discussion about creating a new offense for "reckless" breaches of the general self-isolation requirements with a higher fine, but the FM was not convinced and suggested that police officers must be experienced in handling cases involving the concept of recklessness. The recommendation is to test this with stakeholders and come back with further advice.

7. Ministers agreed on the need for a systematic review to ensure there is clarity about the respective roles and responsibilities of different enforcing authorities for each offense. They are considering how to take this forward.

8. Discussion with all enforcing authorities to ensure there is a shared understanding of what offenses are most serious in the COVID context, and that the law enforcement response is appropriate to the level of seriousness. The Ministers agreed on taking this forward but the details were not provided. 

In addition, there's mention of unlicensed music events where officials recommended retaining a £1000 fine with the police's preference for deterrence. The CG was content with all the proposals relating to penalties for businesses in the review.


This text discusses proposed changes to penalty fines for businesses and house parties in response to ongoing COVID-19 restrictions. The current fine scale starts at £200, but the Chief Officer (CG) suggests that a £500 fine feels more appropriate due to consistency with other UK penalties and the seriousness of the offense. Therefore, they recommend increasing both the penalty for organizing an event with over 15 people indoors or over 30 people outdoors to £500. This change would bring more coherence to the penalty scales and act as a stronger deterrent against house party organizing during pub closures. The text also mentions feedback from various officials regarding fine proposal reviews but notes that the First Minister does not feel able to agree in principle to the amendments proposed without further discussion.


The writer is requesting the First Minister of Wales to consider the review of fixed penalty notices (FPNs) in England before making a decision. The writer suggests that if FPNs are not addressed, it may affect the views of the Welsh police. The remaining proposals for consideration seem less contentious but the writer would like Ministers to comment on them as well. A translation of the draft Written Statement will be provided tomorrow.
