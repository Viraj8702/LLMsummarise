Dr. Chris Williams, a consultant epidemiologist at Public Health Wales, provides information on COVID-19 hospital admissions and inpatient data for the period from 1 February 2020 to 28 June 2022 in response to a request for evidence by the Inquiry Team. He explains that a COVID-19 case is defined by Public Health Wales as a person with a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test taken in Wales, and hospital admissions include those admitted to a hospital in Wales for at least one night within 28 days after a positive test taken in Wales or where the patient tested positive in hospital up to 2 days after admission. From May 2022, the de-duplication period increased to 90 days. He also describes how PCR test data was extracted from the Public Health Wales Datastore database and hospital admissions data was extracted from the hospital patient administrative system (PAS) via ICNET, with patient and test data linked using the patient NHS number. Dr. Williams provides information on the nearly 24,000 COVID-19 case admissions to hospitals in Wales over approximately 16 months, with Cwm Taf Morgannwg UHB having the highest number of case admissions (21% of total cases).


This text discusses the number of coronavirus (COVID-19) cases admitted to hospitals and intensive care units in Wales, as well as fluctuations in these figures over a period of 16 months. It mentions that during this time, there have been four peaks in COVID-19 case hospital admissions, with the first peaking at the end of March 2020, followed by another peak in late December 2020 and early January 2021, as well as smaller peaks from autumn 2021 onwards. The text also explains that variations in case admissions are influenced by changes in the underlying incidence of COVID-19 over time, the availability of testing, the severity of disease associated with different variants, the progress of the vaccination campaign, and improvements in community management of the disease. Additionally, it states that peaks in intensive care admissions reflect the timing of the peaks in COVID-19 case hospital admissions.


The text discusses the reduction of intensive care admissions and improved patient treatments and management during COVID-19 pandemic. Health boards have experienced peaks at similar times, with Hywel Dda UHB having consistently lower case admissions. Cwm Taf Morgannwg UHB had the highest number of cases in wave 2 but Betsi Cadwaladr UHB observed higher cases later on. Wave 2 had larger differences in health board admissions compared to subsequent waves. Additionally, weekly intensive care admissions data for COVID-19 is difficult to interpret due to small numbers, especially for Betsi Cadwaladr and Hywel Dda UHBs.


This report analyzes the distribution of hospital and intensive care admissions for confirmed COVID-19 cases by age group in the United Kingdom from September to December 2021. The highest number of cases admitted to hospital was in individuals aged 60-79 years, comprising more than a third of all admitted cases. In contrast, the fewest case admissions were in the 0-19 age group, making up only six percent of total cases admitted to hospital. Intensive care admissions saw higher numbers in the 60-79 age group, accounting for 45% of total intensive care admissions. The report concludes that these distributions are influenced by both underlying population age distribution and more severe outcome profiles in older age groups due to co-morbidities and other factors associated with increasing age.


This text provides an overview of COVID-19 cases admitted to hospital and intensive care, specifically focusing on gender differences. From January 2020 to June 2022, there were more male case admissions to hospital than females initially; however, this trend shifted from early 2022, with a higher number of female case admissions. Table 3 shows the distribution of confirmed COVID-19 cases admitted to hospital by sex and Figure 7 displays the weekly number of such cases admitted to hospital by gender. Additionally, Figure 8 illustrates the weekly number of confirmed COVID-19 cases admitted to intensive care by sex over the same period.


The text describes the distribution of COVID-19 cases admitted to hospital and intensive care by deprivation quintile in Wales between March 1, 2020, and June 26, 2022. It highlights that more male than female cases were admitted to intensive care over time, with a noticeable difference in the first two waves. The majority of the reduction observed in cases admitted to intensive care in the autumn of 2021 was due to a decrease in male cases admitted to intensive care in Wales. The Welsh Index of Multiple Deprivation ranks small areas in Wales from 1 (most deprived) to 1,909 (least deprived), with 79% and 78% of case admissions being assigned to a deprivation quintile. A similar pattern was observed for both hospital and intensive care case admissions, but the percentage difference between the most and least deprived quintiles was larger for intensive care cases. Within each deprivation quintile, a similar percentage of case admissions were admitted to intensive care, with the highest percentage (8.7%) observed in the most deprived quintile and the lowest percentage (7.6%) in the least deprived quintile. In Wales, a COVID-19 hospital inpatient is defined as a person in a hospital in Wales on a Sunday who has spent at least one night in hospital and has had a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test taken in Wales in the previous 28 days. A COVID-19 intensive care inpatient is defined as a person in an intensive care unit in a hospital in Wales on a Sunday who has spent at least one night in intensive care and has had a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test taken in Wales in the previous 28 days, excluding inpatients in high dependency units. The data does not include inpatient information from high dependency units.


This text provides an overview of data related to COVID-19 hospital admissions in Wales, specifically focusing on inpatient data extracted from the hospital patient administrative system (PAS) via ICNET. The data also includes information on COVID-19 intensive care hospital inpatients. The text discusses the similarities between the trends of COVID-19 inpatient cases and the COVID-19 case admissions, as well as mentioning the potential reasons behind increased transmissibility of the Omicron variant in hospital settings. It provides a graphical representation of the count of COVID-19 hospital inpatients on the last day of week for various time periods. The text concludes by stating that trends in intensive care COVID-19 inpatients followed those of general COVID-19 inpatient numbers, with the largest number of intensive care COVID-19 inpatients occurring in April 2020 and January 2021.


The text provides a summary of COVID-19 hospital and intensive care inpatient numbers for different Health Boards in Wales between Wave 2 and subsequent waves, from week ending 8th March 2020 to 26th June 2022. It highlights the varying peaks experienced by these health boards, with Cwm Taf Morgannwg UHB recording the highest number of COVID-19 patients in Winter 2020/21, with over 500 patients in their hospitals. In contrast, Betsi Cadwaladr UHB experienced considerably higher numbers of intensive care inpatient cases in January and April 2022. The text also mentions that, overall, COVID-19 inpatient numbers decreased to much lower peaks following Wave 2.


This text discusses the distribution of COVID-19 hospital inpatients based on age and sex in Wales from week ending 8th March 2020 to 26th June 2022. The analysis shows that cases admitted were consistently highest in the 60-79 age group, whereas inpatient cases were consistently highest in the 80+ age group. There was a small increase in inpatients in the youngest age group over time. Intensive care hospital inpatients were predominantly from the 60-79 and 40-59 age groups, with very few inpatient cases from the youngest and oldest age groups. The text does not provide detailed information on the peaks in inpatients across different age groups and waves.


The text provides information about COVID-19 hospitalizations in Wales between the periods of January 8, 2022, and June 26, 2022. It discusses gender disparities in hospitalization rates for patients with coronavirus during different waves. The analysis shows that, after the first wave, there were consistently more female COVID-19 inpatient hospitalizations than male, but these differences have been relatively small. Moreover, the data does not enable an assessment of other protected characteristics such as ethnicity or vulnerabilities. A breakdown by index of multiple deprivation is possible but would require a significant amount of new analysis due to the point prevalence data on current inpatients being collected each Sunday and aggregated for postcode-based depravation mapping. It also states that Powys Teaching Health Board does not have acute hospitals, and residents may be admitted to hospitals outside Wales; hence their admissions are excluded from the analysis.
