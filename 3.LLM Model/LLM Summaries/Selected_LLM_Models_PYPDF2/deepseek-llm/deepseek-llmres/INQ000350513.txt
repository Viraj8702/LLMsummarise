The text is a draft piece discussing a strategic approach to combatting the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK. The author proposes a maximum short-term suppression strategy, which involves immediately containing the disease within households by closing non-essential businesses and allowing only one person out for essential purposes. This would be done for a defined period of time, with an end point determined by certain conditions being met (e.g., when new hospital admissions from Wales get to lower than 5 per day). The public should be made aware of the importance of their role in containing the virus and that after a short period of containment, traditional methods of dealing with communicable disease outbreaks but on a larger scale and with a faster pace will be used. It is suggested that whatever is done now may need to be repeated in the future due to mutation rate of the current outbreak. The author clarifies that this draft piece has not yet been fully cleared for distribution, and asks readers to keep it within government for now.
