This guidance document outlines the management of Private Office records for ministers and permanent secretaries' offices. It was originally issued in April 2001 and revised in June 2004, with an extension to include the creation of records. The latest version focuses on clarifying aspects related to governance requirements. This guidance applies to all information created in any medium, including new technologies such as instant messaging, blackberries, and texts. It covers meetings/events that take place within Private Offices where decisions are made regarding departmental or government policy. Special Advisers' records also require separate consideration, with their papers being managed separately if they only mirror existing records within the department. Electronic systems used in Private Offices need to be managed effectively to ensure compliance with various statutory and non-statutory requirements such as the Public Records Act 1958, Freedom of Information Act 2000, Data Protection Act 1998, Environmental Information Regulations 2004, and Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988. The guidance is intended to supplement other relevant policies and should be kept under review as electronic systems develop and change.


The text discusses information management regulations for public authorities under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988, and FOIA Code of Practice Section 46. It emphasizes the importance of maintaining good records and information management procedures to ensure the availability and retrieval of records when required. The guidance covers various types of records created or held by private offices, including correspondence with ministers from other departments, submissions from policy areas, notes from meetings, and ministerial diaries. Constituency and party political records and those related to a minister's personal interests are not covered by this guidance and should be managed separately according to the Minister's wishes.


This text discusses the importance of keeping accurate records for ministers, detailing what events should be recorded as part of a minister's official work. The text outlines four categories that require recording: ministerial diaries, responses to policy areas and other noting Minister's decisions & views; meetings between different groups such as Ministers, officials, departments etc., phone conversations, instant messaging and text discussions related to official business; telephone conversations & party political meetings; and goodwill visits or hospitality where no policy decisions arise.

The text also discusses special categories of records that require specific management, including: Ministers' official diaries (public records), records of formal meetings with outside interest groups/lobbyists, Private Secretaries' notes, exclusively internal Private Office papers, declined invitations, and Ministers' and Private Secretaries' notebooks. The relevant Private Offices should manage these special categories and ensure that they are preserved for safekeeping by the DRO, following guidance issued by Sir Robin Butler in 1995.


This text is about managing records in private offices for government officials. It suggests different types of records that should be kept and how long they should be kept for. The text says that sensitive papers, some registered files, declined invitations, Ministers' notebooks, and copies of outgoing correspondence should all be managed according to a specific process agreed with the Data Retention Officer (DRO). The text also provides best practice recommendations for managing private office records, suggesting different models that can be used depending on an office's needs.


This text discusses two models for managing records within a government organization. The first model is the recommended approach and involves both Private Offices (which are essentially personal offices or support staff for Ministers) retaining their own records, as well as policy areas (areas of responsibility within the department) also retaining their own records. This system aims to manage risk by ensuring that there is clear accountability for managing risks in case information critical for decision making isn't available when needed. Therefore, both Private Offices and policy areas are responsible for properly capturing and storing records in the departmental record system.

The second model (not recommended) relies on policy areas solely retaining full and accurate records within their respective responsibilities. However, it also states that private offices do not need to capture the records they handle into the departmental records system; instead, they delegate this responsibility to the responsible policy area. This can pose a risk as senior officials' reputations could be severely damaged if key information is not readily available as evidence of their decision-making process.

In both models, it is necessary for private offices and policy areas to work together in order to ensure that any comments or annotations are conveyed back and forth between the two entities, so they have a complete picture. The original records should be stored electronically if possible, but hard copies will also need to be maintained depending on the nature of the record.

In addition, both models require private offices to maintain a record of electronic submissions along with any paper submissions, as well as transmitting Private Secretary notes or annotated submission copy to policy areas recording their response and necessary actions. If non-captured records are stored within private office space, they must be handed over to the Departmental Records Officer (DRO) at an agreed time, such as during changes of administration in ministerial offices.

Finally, it is crucial for both models that private offices do not dispose or weed through their own records; this responsibility lies with DRO who will conduct any weeding or disposal of records.


The text provides guidance on record management procedures for Private Offices, emphasizing that they need to have confidence in other departments' policy areas where there is cross-department working. It suggests appropriate storage and disposal schedules for different types of records, such as Minister's Notebooks, files of correspondence, and outgoing material. The document also mentions that if further advice is required on matters covered in this guidance, it can be obtained from TNA, and the guidance will be updated at regular intervals.


The text discusses the management of various types of official documents, electronic versions, and web content within a government organization. The organization follows specific guidelines for retaining or destroying such records according to their nature and relevance. These include events like media coverage, visits, shared drives (both personal and organizational), email, USB sticks, and palm-top devices. Regularly updated content from non-departmental sites like Flickr and YouTube are also captured and maintained in the electronic records management system for six months before being destroyed. 

Ministerial briefings, including paper copies and electronic versions stored on ERM or other appropriate systems, need to be kept. This includes wikis, blogs, official and unofficial government websites with web-based content such as YouTube videos, discussion forums, social networking sites, and instant messaging platforms. The text recommends capturing material from these sources at regular intervals and passing the records to the DRO for permanent preservation.

The management of meeting minutes is also covered, with paper copies and electronic versions stored on ERM or shared drives after one year being passed to the DRO. This applies to formal meetings, interest group/lobbyist interactions, non-fixed information exchange methods such as telephone calls (both official business and significant phone calls), email attachments, film/audio files, and email correspondence with retained records in a separate file that should be agreed on by both parties regarding retention periods.

The Private Office model 1 further emphasizes the importance of ensuring that records are stored within the departmental records system. For non-departmental content relevant to policy areas, it is necessary to gather these resources and pass them to the Departmental Records Officer at an agreed interval for permanent preservation.


The text provides guidelines for effective record-keeping in private offices, specifically outlining best practices for handling various types of correspondence and communication methods. The aim is to ensure proper documentation of substantive issues and demonstrate accountability. These include Binet meetings where notes are taken, telephone conversations with records kept on discussions concerning substantive matters, instant messaging which should be recorded as well, oral briefings requiring notes if necessary, Minister's official diaries that need correction reflecting actual appointments, web forums discussion records, and material coming into the private offices such as correspondence from outside the department or submissions. The text also emphasizes proper storage of these documents in the departmental records system for easy accessibility while copies can be sent to the Departmental Records Officer if stored outside the system. Additionally, materials being sent out from the private office should include correspondence and documentation with response or decision related to a minister's area of responsibility, which require safekeeping within the Private Office. Finally, good record-management is crucial for reconstructing the policy story effectively, and these guidelines are intended as supplementary advice rather than replacements for other existing guidance on running a private office.
