The Welsh Government has published an Information Management and Governance Policy to ensure that the management of its information and records adheres to certain standards. The policy aims to identify vital and important records while ensuring legal and regulatory obligations are met. It defines roles and responsibilities for creating, safekeeping, assuring, using, reusing, storing, sharing, publishing, and disposing of information throughout its life cycle. This includes an eight-stage Information Lifecycle (Create, Assure, Use, Store, Access, Share, Publish, Dispose). The policy replaces the previous Welsh Government Information and Records Management Policy from May 2015 and is supported by a framework of more detailed data, information, and security policies.


The text outlines a policy for managing information security within the Welsh Government, focusing on ensuring appropriate protection of information while also making full use of it for organizational benefit. This includes assessing risks, balancing protection with usage, creating a risk-aware culture, and implementing measures to prevent unauthorized access or destruction. The policy also covers compliance with legal requirements, appointment of qualified individuals, privacy considerations, and maintaining up-to-date records on information assets. Additionally, the text explains that privacy by design should be considered in the initial development stages of products or services involving personal data processing.


This policy outlines the guidelines for storing, accessing, and sharing business information within the Welsh Government to maximize efficiency, reduce costs, enable sharing, and minimize risks. It covers storage of electronic and physical data on approved systems, protecting personal data, limiting removable media usage, applying access controls, and ensuring information is accessible and retrievable. Additionally, the policy emphasizes sharing information internally and externally while complying with legal requirements such as Freedom of Information Act 2000, General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), Data Protection Act 2018, Environmental Information Regulations, Re-use of Public Sector Information Regulations 2015, and Copyright Act 1988.


The Welsh Government has developed an Information Management and Governance Policy to ensure the quality, accessibility, protection of intellectual property rights, and security of information published externally as well as the proper disposal of information at its end-of-life. The policy applies to all forms of information such as documents, websites, social media, etc., and is designed to be compliant with relevant legislation like Freedom of Information Act, GDPR, Data Protection Act 2018, Environmental Information Regulations (EIR), and Public Sector Information Regulations (RPSI). It aims at ensuring the appropriate handling of personal data in accordance with privacy notices. The policy also covers corporate information management systems that include hardware, IT equipment, approved software, hardcopy materials, websites, social media, etc., along with their associated requirements for use and disposal.


This document outlines the policies and procedures for managing information assets within the Welsh Government. It covers a wide range of topics related to hardcopy documents, websites, social media, text messaging, email management, data protection, open data, public inquiries, litigation, and other areas. The goal is to ensure that the organization complies with relevant legislation and regulations while protecting sensitive personal information and allowing access to those who need it. This policy applies to all personnel working on behalf of the Welsh Government, including employees, contractors, and subcontractors.


The text discusses the need for an Information Management and Governance Policy within the Welsh Government, citing several pieces of legislation that emphasize the importance of managing information transparently and in compliance with data protection laws. The policy aims to ensure all parties are aware of their obligations regarding efficient and legally compliant management of information and records. The document also outlines key legislation related to public records, freedom of information, data protection, environmental information, and reuse of public sector information.


This policy outlines the management and governance of all information and records created by Welsh Government personnel, which are subject to Crown Copyright under the Re-use of Public Sector Information Regulations 2015. This scope includes digital documents, paper files, social media platforms, emails, diaries, faxes, brochures and reports, intranet and external internet pages, forms, third-party information supplied by Welsh Government or on its behalf, audio and video recordings, maps, images, photographs, microfiche and microfilm, websites, text messages, and other communication tools. The management of these records is guided by the Lord Chancellor's Code of Practice on the Management of Records issued under section 46 of the Freedom of Information Act 2000.

The policy also mentions several related Welsh Government policies and guidance documents such as the Access to Information Code of Practice, Security Policy, Information & Security Policy, Backup policy, Social Media Strategy, Procurement Checklist, Private Office Guidance, SIRO Risk Appetite Statement, Open Data Plan, Data Breaches & 'Near-Misses', Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA), Equality Impact Assessments (EIA), Instant Messaging Policy.

Furthermore, the policy describes corporate information management systems and hardware and IT equipment provided by Welsh Government that are connected to its network servers for access to email, iShare, and other resources as needed. Responsibility for security and safety of this equipment is also outlined in this section of the policy document.


The text discusses various management systems and software approved for storing corporate records and information within the Welsh Government. The systems mentioned include iShare, Shared Drives, HR Self Service, SAP Finance System, PPIMS, CaSSI, EDDMS, IRIS, and Cafcass Cymru CRM system. These systems are used to store different levels of information, from OFFICIAL and INFORMATION to SECRET and TOP SECRET information, in accordance with the Information Security Policy. Certain software packages that do not natively integrate with iShare are stored on teams' shared drives, with pointers from iShare to these repositories. The text also highlights that HR Self Service was previously known as "Snowdrop" and specifies that corporate information must not be stored in an individual's iShare home folder.


The text provides guidelines for information management within the Welsh Government. It emphasizes that all staff have access to iShare Home folders, but corporate information must not be stored in them. The use of iShare's specific features, such as MyTemp and Connect, is detailed; emails should only be kept if they are part of a transaction or evidence, and any temporary files automatically delete after 7 days. External stakeholders can access shared information through Connect, but the external web portal should not be used by staff to manage documents. Other systems like case management, grant management, and geographical information systems may store some records; however, iShare is recommended for official records. The text also discusses hardcopy files, with SECRET and TOP SECRET security classifications, which must be scanned or photographed and saved to virtual files on iShare. Electronic retention of procurement card transactions has been mandated as of April 1st, 2019. Finally, the text emphasizes that staff should not maintain complete sets of hardcopies outside of the official recordkeeping system due to risks related to GDPR, Data Protection Act 2018, and Freedom of Information Act breach.


The text discusses the records management policies of the Welsh Government. Websites and social media content are considered public records and are archived by the National Archives for future access. Text messages and instant messaging systems, such as WG phones and Microsoft Teams, are also considered public records when used for government business, and users must be aware of their impact on recordkeeping. The ephemeral nature of these communication methods emphasizes the importance of managing and preserving content to address some of the challenges associated with text messages (e.g., limited search capabilities, difficulty in associating messages with individual accounts or case files).


The text discusses information management practices within the Welsh Government. It emphasizes the importance of creating an Information Asset Register to ensure appropriate protection and identify responsibility for information assets across various directorates. The register includes Information Asset Owners who are responsible for understanding and managing the information in their respective domains.

When implementing new systems, it is crucial to consider all recordkeeping requirements to meet legal and other obligations such as GDPR/Data Protection Act, Freedom of Information Act, Public Records Act 1958, Statute of Limitations, and Regulatory and Investigatory Powers Act. This includes measures like access control, retention and disposal, audit requirements, and legal admissibility in compliance with standards like BSI DISC PD0008.

The Welsh Government defines information assets as bodies of information that can be understood, shared, protected, and exploited effectively. It has adopted the HMG Security Classification Policy for all records created after April 2014 to preserve administrative history and context while retaining the previous classification system for historical files. For naming conventions, a "Who-What-When" approach is used when creating new records to ensure that their content is clear and catalogued effectively through file metadata. Password protection of documents should not be applied in Welsh Government's documentation as it restricts accessibility and readability, rather using iShare caveated files/folders for special protection or access restrictions. The Information & Records Management Branch will inform project areas about new projects via the iPAF process to ensure information requirements are met during ICT-enabled projects.


The text provides guidelines on how to manage file closures, email usage, and records created by private offices and the Office of the Permanent Secretary. It suggests that when a project is disbanded or completed, files should be closed through contacting file plan managers in iShare. Re-opening of files is not advisable without approval from the Information & Records Management team. For Access to Information requests involving project documentation, the owner of the document at the time of the request bears responsibility for responding.

Duplicate documents and supplementary information no longer needed should be deleted or destroyed. Inactive paper records must be archived through the Information & Records Management team. The text also emphasizes the importance of managing email usage appropriately by saving emails containing official business on record in iShare within 12 months after receipt or creation, as well as ensuring sensitive information is included only in encrypted emails sent to secure addresses.

Guidelines provided apply to private offices producing records subject to Public Records Act and separate considerations must be given to the Special Advisers (SpAds) records.


The text discusses the management of records for special advisers (SpAds) within the Welsh Government. SpAds should be retained if their work has an impact on official business but not if it is merely mirrored by other departments in the government. Private offices must follow the information and records management policies and practices adopted by the Welsh Government, while EU funded records related to the work of the Welsh European Funding Office (WEFO) need to be retained until WEFO confirms they are no longer required due to compliance with EU rules. The text also covers sensitive personal data protection under GDPR and Data Protection Act 2018, where it is essential for the purposes being processed; such data should only be kept as long as necessary.


The text discusses the management of sensitive personal data and exemptions within Data Protection legislation, as well as the use of CCTV across Welsh Government estates and protocols for sharing data with external organizations. It also covers the requirement for personal data to remain within the European Economic Area (EEA) when sending data outside this zone, and how records created through collaborative working or outsourcing are managed.


The text discusses a policy for managing information shared between different bodies, particularly within the public service sector in Wales. It emphasizes the importance of contracts with third parties including references to information management procedures and responsibilities. The contract should outline how records created during collaborative working or outsourcing will be managed, shared, and protected. Both partners must agree on these responsibilities and sign a protocol that outlines who is responsible for various aspects like access to information requests, information security, data quality, retention, and disposal.

The text also mentions the requirement of obtaining assurances from third-party suppliers regarding their handling of information. It explains that they should have at least attained Cyber Essentials certification, which is a set of basic controls aimed at providing network security for organizations and reducing vulnerability to a range of the most common internet threats.

Moreover, it outlines how open data is managed by developing an Open Data Plan for the Welsh Government. The public service sector in Wales generates vast amounts of data that can be opened up and shared, leading to various benefits like those highlighted within Digital First and the Welsh Government's digital action plan. It explains that they use both UK Government Licensing Framework (UKGLF) and Open Government Licence (OGL) for licensing the use and re-use of public sector information.

The text further discusses how machinery of government changes and/or transfers of functions are managed within the Welsh Government. In such cases, the Departmental Records Officer should be informed at the earliest opportunity by project leads to ensure proper transfer of vital business records without any loss in information or interruption to continuity. The Departmental Records Officer must also be involved throughout this process to make sure that correct procedures and legislation are followed during the transfer. All decisions about legal status, movement, disposal, and destruction of information should be documented.

Lastly, it mentions arrangements for transferring computer systems and/or storage media used to create and manage digital records during machinery of government changes or function transfers must also be made via ICT providers to ensure a smooth handover process. Full documentation of files being transferred (regardless of format), along with details regarding outstanding file requests or sensitivity issues, should be documented in the official Transfer Agreement between the transferring and receiving departments which must be signed by both organizations.


The text discusses the transfer of information and records during a change in Machinery of Government process, emphasizing the importance of accountability and proper handling of public inquiries, reviews, and tribunal records. It provides guidance on managing public inquiries, including how to demonstrate their conduct, ensure accessibility to information, and dispose of retained records properly. The text also addresses the responsibility of independent inquiries or tribunals, as well as the need for robust procedures in cases of child or other abuse allegations. Additionally, it covers the management of litigation-related information, such as legal holds, hold orders, and preservation orders, which may be required as evidence for legal purposes.


The text discusses the importance of managing legal discovery and candor for the Welsh Government. Legal discovery involves obtaining advice on behalf of the Welsh Government for litigation purposes or preserving records that may be relevant to a pending or anticipated lawsuit or investigation. The duty to preserve relevant information stems from common law, statutes, and regulations such as the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. To ensure compliance with data protection legislation, the Welsh Government uses an eDiscovery tool to help manage their information explosion, identify what needs to be kept or deleted, and maintain a duty of candor in providing true and comprehensive accounts of decision-making processes. The PIA can also demonstrate compliant data transfer and retention while reducing sensitive personal information that is not relevant to legal proceedings.


The text discusses the duty of disclosure, retention and disposal of information and records by the Welsh Government. It is mandatory for a party to disclose information that exists, and the duty requires a reasonable search. Records will only be retained as long as they are needed to support the business requirements and legal obligations. The Retention and Disposal Schedule sets out recommended periods for retaining specific classes of information based on legal, audit, and operational requirements.

The GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) and Data Protection Act 2018 provide additional requirements around personal data retention, after which it is not necessary to completely erase the data but can be anonymized. This may include methods like deleting unnecessary information, erasing unique identifiers, or separating personal data from non-identifying information.

The Welsh Government must dispose of or transfer records older than 30 years old (known as the 30 Year Rule) under the Public Records Act 1958 and Freedom of Information Act 2000 Section 46. However, due to the Constitutional Reform and Governance Act 2010, this rule was reduced from 30 to 20 years in January 2013. The reduction will be completed by 2023 when records created in 2003 are ready for transfer, making the "20 Year Rule" the new standard.

The Welsh Government is required to monitor its progress through the National Archives, which collates and publishes information management reports annually.


The text discusses the management of public records in different devolved regions within the UK, focusing on Wales and its comparison with other devolved regions like Northern Ireland and Scotland. The Government of Wales Act 1998 established provisions for the preservation of Welsh records, which can be further enforced by an Order under section 147 made by the UK Department of Media, Culture, and Sport (DCMS). As a result, all necessary arrangements must be made to store, preserve, and provide access to public records in Wales. However, establishing a national archive in Wales is expensive, leading to the National Archives being recognized as the repository for both the Welsh government and the UK government.

In Northern Ireland, the Public Records Act (Northern Ireland) 1923 makes archival responsibilities fall under the Public Record Office of Northern Ireland (PRONI). The General Register Office for Scotland merged with the NAS to become the National Records of Scotland (NRS), responsible for various national agencies' archives. In Scotland, a new Public Records (Scotland) Act 2011 replaced the Public Records (Scotland) Act 1937. Meanwhile, in England and Wales, the Keeper of the records of Scotland is responsible for managing all archival materials except those related to civil status. The Chief Executive of the National Archives supervises arrangements for Welsh public records until an Order under section 147 is made by the DCMS, which reviews records upon their retention period's end to determine their usefulness or historical value and transfer them accordingly.


This text outlines the preservation, management and accessibility of public records within the Welsh Government. The Public Records Act requires that departments obtain permission from the Advisory Council if they wish to retain digital records beyond a certain period. To ensure access to digital information, a Digital Continuity project was conducted in 2010 to assess requirements for preserving digital data and explore appropriate solutions. Current information is kept accessible through regular software migrations, while historical data remains accessible for future generations.

Copyright-intellectual property management within the Welsh Government requires that staff obtain rights or copyright clearance before incorporating any intellectual property into documentation or information systems owned by the organization. Social media platforms have different terms of usage regarding content ownership, with some claiming copyright over posted content.

The public can access Welsh Government Public Records through two main methods: searching the National Archives' online catalogue and placing a Freedom of Information (FOI) request for less than thirty years old records in accordance with FOIA 2000. The external Welsh Government website provides guidance on accessing information via these methods.


This document outlines the procedures for managing access to information and records within the Welsh Government. To request information, follow the guidelines for placing a data subject access request. The organization catalogs its research reports and publications to ensure they are accessible to the public, with electronic Crown Copyright material emailed to Library-Enquiries for cataloging within one month of publication.

Staff must complete mandatory training on information management every two years, while those in Inspectorate and Advisory areas must do so annually. Compliance is monitored through regular assessments by The National Archives. When leaving the Welsh Government, departing employees must ensure that they deal with any ongoing work and properly dispose of records to avoid unnecessary storage costs and maintain accountability for their work.

The Welsh Government complies with data protection laws such as the GDPR, Data Protection Act 2018, and Law Enforcement Directive (LED), responding accurately and within legal response times to freedom of information and subject access requests. No Welsh Government information should be retained by leavers; see the "How Do I" guide for instructions on disposing of records properly.


This text discusses the retention of WPC (Welsh Public Careers) transaction records by cardholders using iShare, a system that stores electronic receipts and other documents related to WPC transactions. The user is required to request a receipt if one is not automatically offered, scan or photograph it, and upload it into their iShare file with a title corresponding to the item in BSM (Business Systems Management). Eligible scanned records must be retained for at least 7 years after the end of the financial year when payment was made or 12 years from the closure date of a relevant EU-funded programme. Copies of receipts can also be demanded by HMRC (Her Majesty's Revenue & Customs) with statutory inspection powers. In exceptional circumstances where receipts are not available, an explanation should be provided in a file note countersigned by the transaction approver and uploaded into the iShare file, following the guidance for retaining and logging these documents on BSM. Cardholders without access to iShare should make arrangements for a colleague within their directorate to upload the receipts or contact the Card Administrator in exceptional circumstances for assistance.
