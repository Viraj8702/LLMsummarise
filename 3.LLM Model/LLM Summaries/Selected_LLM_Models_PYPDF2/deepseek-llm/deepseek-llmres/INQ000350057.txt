The Technical Advisory Group in Wales has released a statement on non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) that should be implemented in the pre-Christmas period to curb the spread of COVID-19. Social distancing and quarantine remain effective in reducing the risk of spreading the virus, while self-isolation remains crucial for individuals with COVID-19 symptoms. The group highlights a misunderstanding of risks associated with household mixing and recommends keeping households from mingling to lower transmission rates. Policy modeling shows that introducing Tier 3 restrictions before Christmas would help reduce hospital and ICU beds required for COVID-19 patients and deaths.


The text discusses the current COVID-19 situation in Wales, with 15 out of 22 local authorities being classified as very high for cases per 100,000 population, and four health boards (Aneurin Bevan, Cwm Taf Morgannwg, Swansea Bay, Hywel Da, Powys, Betsi Cadwaladr) falling under the category of high cases per 100,000. The text also mentions an increase in COVID-19 cases among the over 60s population and concerns about potential hospital admissions and deaths increasing within the next two to three weeks. Interventions implemented during the coronavirus pandemic include local health protection measures and the firebreak in Wales.

The impact of winter celebrations, such as Christmas, is highlighted as a risk for increased virus transmission due to intergenerational mixing, which could lead to higher hospitalizations and deaths after the holiday season. The text also briefly discusses rapid testing technologies that may not provide complete solutions to the pandemic, emphasizing the importance of social distancing and quarantining in reducing the spread of COVID-19.


The text discusses the need for people to potentially self-isolate or quarantine over the Christmas period due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Pre-isolating for one incubation period (approximately 10 days) by not mixing outside of the household could help mitigate the risk of spreading the virus, as evidence suggests most transmission occurs through prolonged and close contact within homes. It is advised that people avoid seeing others during this period, especially older relatives, and consider meeting remotely or postponing celebrations until next year.

The article also highlights that pre-isolation may be helpful for families with children before visiting older adults, as well as in occupations where there is a higher risk of infection (such as warehouse, factory, health, and social care workers). The best way to protect older family members from potential infections is by not exposing them to any contact, even if the intention is well-meaning.

Widespread vaccination will be necessary before current restrictions are no longer required, but in the meantime, people should use sensible advice on how to visit families as safely as possible, such as reducing the length of stay and practicing good hand hygiene and ventilation. The hospitality sector, including bars, restaurants, and entertainment venues, pose a higher transmission risk due to their crowded, poorly ventilated spaces, and close face-to-face interactions that may be exacerbated by alcohol consumption.

Finally, the text mentions that recent SAGE papers have explored how to approach Christmas and festivals during the pandemic and have considered the impacts of hospitality on the epidemic while highlighting the risks associated with it. It is essential for people to understand these environmental and behavioral factors when engaging in holiday gatherings or social activities this season.


The text discusses the correlation between dining at restaurants or visiting bars/coffee shops and contracting COVID-19. It also mentions a Public Health England investigation indicating an association between working in certain occupational groups (warehouse settings, construction, and hospitality), as well as health and social care, and increased odds of becoming a COVID-19 case. The text emphasizes that TTP teams collect exposure data from cases and contacts which can be used to evaluate potential exposures for evidence of clustering but should not be used to establish cause and effect without additional caution. Additionally, the text highlights the enforcement data indicating that hospitality is consistently the most common setting for Premises Improvement Notices (61%) and Premises Closure Notices (78%). However, it's important to note that despite efforts from the industry to provide COVID-secure environments, it's not possible to entirely separate linking activities that also confer higher risks of transmission. The text also mentions a rise in cases among school students and teachers, which is expected as community case rates increase. While there is no clear evidence of a causative relationship between schools being open and increased infection rates, the available evidence suggests an association with potentially complex underlying factors such as reopening workplaces, parents returning to work, shop openings, and social mixing outside schools that link households and different networks together.


The text discusses the potential impact of school closures on the spread of COVID-19 and the associated harms. It highlights that closing schools should be considered as a last resort due to the risks it poses to children's physical, mental health, and well-being. The decision to partially close schools during the autumn firebreak in Wales took into account earlier SAGE advice on modeled impacts. However, the text also mentions that movement data suggests school closures may increase mobility instead of reducing transmission risk. 

The text further explains that closing schools should not be viewed solely as an intervention to prevent transmission but rather a tool for mitigating wider socio-economic harms caused by school closures, such as remote learning and other mitigation measures. However, these options could potentially increase inequality as online learning is less accessible to lower socioeconomic groups. 

The text also discusses the potential impact of extended Christmas bubble agreements on increasing transmission risk within households during this period. It suggests that decisions about additional school closures beyond the Christmas period should consider further evidence as it becomes available, given the significant wider harms caused by school closures. Lastly, the text emphasizes that continued efforts to promote shared responsibility for longer-term behavior change are necessary, acknowledging that some individuals may not adhere fully to existing guidelines due to various reasons.


The text discusses the impact of minor breaches of guidelines on population level adherence and highlights the barriers that prevent people from adhering to them, such as lack of understanding, skills, and access to support. Confidence in the Welsh Government remains high, but some individuals are less likely to comply with restrictions due to disagreements or other reasons. Surveys show that people mix more within their homes outside extended households, which increases transmission risk. Objective mobility data indicate higher levels of travel post-firebreak. The text speculates that changing behavior following relaxation of restrictions and greater mixing during the pre-Christmas period may increase risks of transmission in the community. It mentions that many evidence-informed behavioral considerations remain the same as spring; these include public communication around risk, financial support, social and emotional support, appropriate communication channels reflecting demographic and cultural differences, and avoiding enforcement without first engaging with people and considering equitable deployment.


The text discusses various strategies to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 during the festive season. It emphasizes that interventions should be implemented early and are more effective when they are short and sharp. Simple rules that are easy to understand and achieve should be established, with clear beginning and end points. The SAGE (Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies) advises against entering the Christmas period with high community transmission levels.

Policy modeling has shown that implementing tier 2 or 3 restrictions can help reduce transmission in communities. Swansea University has developed a model to analyze different policy options, considering scenarios of either Scottish level 2 or 3 or English tier 2 or 3 transmission rates before Christmas. The aim is to minimize deaths, NHS occupancy, and ICU bed usage by keeping Rt generally lower.

The text also highlights that the transmission rate scenarios were based on a pre-firebreak (16 October) Rt value of 19-5-november-2020 31 november-2020 az fty-eighth-sage-meeting-on-covid-19-21-september-2020 7-september-2020 3e 3.

The provided text discusses various modeling scenarios for the impact of COVID-19 during the Christmas period. These scenarios explore the effects of different levels of intervention, contact scaling, and background RT (transmission rate). The analysis assumes a pre-Christmas Rt of 1.3 and a post-Firebreak Rt of either 1.3 or 1.4 for various policy decisions.

The text presents four tiers of interventions: Tier 2 with contact scaling 0.7, Tier 3 with contact scaling 0.75, Tier 2 after adjusting the scaling to 0.75 due to rising cases, and Dec_Measuras_Only without any additional measures in January or February.

The outcomes of these scenarios vary depending on the background RT value:
- In the 'No Intervention' scenario (Rt = 1.3), there would be an estimated 8,570 hospital bed requirements, 1,030 ICU admissions, and 2,520 deaths by December 28th.
- The 'Tier 2' scenario (Rt = 1.3) with contact scaling results in a slightly higher number of hospital and ICU beds required, deaths, and ICU admissions but less than the 'No Intervention' scenario.
- The 'Tier 3' scenarios (Rt = 1.3 or Rt = 1.4) predict even more significant impacts on hospitals with increased bed requirements, ICU admissions, and deaths, compared to previous scenarios. In particular, the 'Tier 3' (Rt = 1.4) scenario results in far higher numbers of hospital beds and ICU admissions required, as well as substantially increased deaths.
- The 'Dec_Measuras_Only' scenario without any additional measures from January or February also presents concerning outcomes for both Rt values but has slightly lower figures than the other scenarios with intervention.

Overall, these modeling results highlight the importance of implementing targeted and effective interventions during the Christmas period to minimize the impact on hospitals and ICU beds.
