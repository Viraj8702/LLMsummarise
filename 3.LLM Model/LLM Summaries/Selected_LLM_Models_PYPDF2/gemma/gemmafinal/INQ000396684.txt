## Summary: Management of Private Office Records

**Record Retention:**

- Sensitive papers: kept within the Private Office but passed to the DRO at an agreed time.
- Registered files: kept electronically or paper-based if not stored elsewhere.
- Declined invitations: kept for an agreed period with the DRO then destroyed.
- Private Secretaries' notebooks: destroyed after 6 months, with information transferred to the official record.
- Ministers' notebooks: retained throughout the tenure and transferred to the DRO upon leaving office.

**Best Practice Models:**

- Model 1: Private Offices retain records for Ministers and policy areas also retain relevant records.
- Departments should agree on a retention model with the DRO to ensure accountability.

**Key Considerations:**

- Ensure all components of a record are retained, regardless of the format (electronic or paper).
- Many departments already use systems for tracking correspondence and managing electronic records.


**Model 1: Private Offices Retain Own Records**

- Recommended approach, where both Private Offices and policy areas retain records.
- Private Offices capture all records, annotations, and comments.
- Policy areas retain complete records for evidential and knowledge management purposes.

**Key Requirements:**

- Clear accountability and risk management.
- Communication of annotations between Private Offices and policy areas.
- Transferring electronically filed submissions to policy areas.

**Model 2: Reliance on Policy Areas**

- Policy areas responsible for capturing and storing departmental records.
- Private Offices delegate the record-keeping burden to policy areas.

**Note:**

- Model 1 is considered riskier due to potential damage to reputations if key records are unavailable.
- Weeding or disposing of records should be handled by the Department Records Office (DRO).


## Summary:
