Title: INQ000350057 - Paper from Welsh Government Technical Advisory Group titled statement regarding NPIs in the pre-christmas period, dated 02/12/2020.

## Summary:

**Purpose:**

* To justify the implementation of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) in Wales during the pre-Christmas period.

**Key Findings:**

* Social distancing and quarantining are highly effective in reducing transmission.
* Increased mixing of households and individuals in indoor settings significantly raises the risk of transmission.
* Modelling suggests that implementing restrictions similar to Tier 3 prior to the relaxation of current measures would reduce hospitalizations and deaths.

**Current Situation:**

* Case rates in Wales remain high, especially in certain areas.
* Test positivity appears to have stabilized in recent weeks after a peak in October.
* Rates of transmission are increasing in 15 out of 22 local authorities.

**Conclusion:**

* NPIs are necessary to control the spread of COVID-19 in Wales and prevent a resurgence of cases after the firebreak.
* Early intervention with restrictions is crucial for mitigating the impact of the virus on healthcare systems and society.


## Summary:

**COVID-19 in Wales:**

* **High infection rates:** Wales has one of the highest rates of COVID-19 in the UK, with over 200 cases per 100,000 people.
* **Increased hospitalizations:** There is concern about an increasing number of hospitalizations in over 60-year-olds.
* **Firebreak impact:** The recent Firebreak lockdown had a positive impact on reducing transmission.
* **Upcoming challenges:** Increased social mixing during Christmas gatherings is likely to lead to further transmission.
* **Testing limitations:** New rapid testing technologies may not be as accurate as traditional PCR tests.
* **Isolation measures:** Social distancing and quarantining remain important to reduce transmission.


## Summary:

**Christmas and Social Gatherings during COVID-19:**

* Due to the Christmas period increasing risk of infection, self-isolation/quarantine, pre-isolation (10 days) or postponement of celebrations are advised.
* Pre-isolation is especially recommended for high-risk individuals like healthcare workers or those working in warehouses.
* Minimize exposure to vulnerable family members, and prioritize physical distancing.
* Widespread vaccination is the ultimate solution to current restrictions.
* COVID-19 transmission is heavily influenced by close, prolonged interactions in poorly ventilated spaces.
* Alcohol consumption can worsen social distancing and jeopardize contact tracing.

**Additional Points:**

* Evidence suggests most transmission happens within households.
* Guidance from SAGE highlights approaches to celebrating Christmas during the pandemic.
* The hospitality sector poses increased transmission risks due to close, prolonged interactions in poorly ventilated spaces.


## Summary:

**Associations with COVID-19 infection:**

* **Social activities:** Dining at restaurants, going to bars/coffee shops, and entertainment activities were associated with increased odds of infection.
* **Occupational exposure:** Working in warehouse settings, construction, hospitality, and healthcare were linked to an increased risk of being a confirmed COVID-19 case.
* **Commercial settings:** Wet pubs and clubs were the most common commercial settings associated with COVID-19 clusters, accounting for 23% of reported clusters.

**Implications:**

* Despite precautions, COVID-19 transmission remains linked to social and occupational activities.
* Accurate data collection is necessary to better understand the association between specific settings and infection.
* Schools reopening may be associated with increased infection rates, but the exact mechanism needs further investigation.


## Summary:

**School closures and their impact:**

* School closures were implemented late in the pandemic when transmission was already high, potentially leading to increased mobility.
* While closures may mitigate transmission within schools, they harm children's physical, mental health, and learning.
* Studies suggest older children contribute more to household transmission.

**Potential options to mitigate harms:**

* Remote learning or hub schools
* Shortening summer holidays 
* However, these measures risk widening inequality.

**Future decisions:**

* Monitoring data and evidence is crucial for future school closure decisions.
* If schools partially reopen, isolation measures and displacement activities should be considered.

**Wider concerns:**

* Adherence to guidelines remains variable, requiring ongoing collective responsibility efforts.


## Summary:

**Adherence to COVID-19 guidelines in Wales:**

* Most people in Wales are adhering to guidelines, but some exceptions exist due to:
    - Lack of understanding or access to support
    - Difficulty saying no
* While trust in the Welsh Government remains high, disagreement with restrictions can lead to non-compliance.
* Some mixing in homes and misunderstanding about transmission risks exist.
* Mobility data suggest a return to pre-firebreak levels of travel.
* Possible increased risk of transmission due to:
    - Changing behaviour post-firebreak restrictions
    - Increased social mixing in the pre-Christmas period
    - Complacency with the availability of vaccines

**Recommendations:**

* Clear and simple communication about risks is essential.
* Financial and social support should be continued.
* Use appropriate communication channels and co-produce interventions.
* Prioritize engagement and encouragement before enforcement.


## Summary:

**Background:** 
* Increased social behaviour around the festive season can contribute to COVID-19 transmission.
* Early intervention is more effective than later intervention.

**Analysis:**
* Policy scenarios were modelled for both pre-Christmas (Tier 2/3 UK level) and post-Christmas periods.
* Reducing social mixing would significantly reduce deaths (estimated 2,520 vs 3,270 deaths for Rt values of 1.3 and 1.4 respectively).

**Key Findings:**
* Early and short interventions are most effective.
* Adherence to restrictions wanes over time.
* Harder restrictions (Tier 3+) can reduce community transmission.
* Simple, understandable, and achievable rules are crucial.

**Possible Actions:**
* Implement non-pharmaceutical interventions before and after Christmas to control transmission.
* Reduce social mixing to minimize the impact of holidays on COVID-19 spread.


## Summary:

The provided text discusses potential COVID-19 scenarios during the Christmas period based on different background Rt values (1.3 and 1.4) and policy interventions. 

**Key findings:**

* **Increased transmission:** 10% additional transmission is estimated due to additional mixing during the holiday season.
* **Hospital/ICU capacity:** 
    * With a background Rt of 1.3:
        * 8,570 hospital and 1,030 ICU beds required.
        * 2,520 deaths estimated.
    * With a background Rt of 1.4:
        * 8,850 hospital and 1,060 ICU beds required.
        * 2,510 deaths estimated.
* **Policy scenarios:**
    * **Tier 2:** Contact scaling reduced by 30%, resulting in reduced hospital and ICU admissions/deaths.
    * **Tier 3:** More stringent contact scaling reduction (75%), potentially preventing the healthcare system from being overwhelmed.


**Conclusion:**

The text emphasizes the importance of implementing additional measures to control COVID-19 transmission during the holidays, especially if the background Rt is high.
