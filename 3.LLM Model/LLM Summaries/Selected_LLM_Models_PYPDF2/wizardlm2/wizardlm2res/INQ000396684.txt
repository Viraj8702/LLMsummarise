 The guidance on managing Private Office records is an update from April 2001 and June 2004, aiming to provide clear instructions on handling records throughout their lifecycle. This includes the creation, maintenance, and eventual disposal of records within the offices of Ministers and Permanent Secretaries, as well as in other high-level public service roles such as Director Generals, Chief Medical Officers, Chief Nursing Officers, Chief Scientific Advisers, Agency Chief Executives, and Regional Directors.

The guidance is designed to ensure that all records, regardless of their format (including digital formats like instant messaging, Blackberries, and texts), are managed appropriately to maintain accountability and support decision-making processes. It emphasizes the importance of recording information from meetings and events where significant decisions about departmental or government policy are made.

Special attention is given to the records of Special Advisers, whose roles directly impact official business. These records should be retained by the department if they offer a unique perspective or contribute significantly to the department's activities. Conversely, if the Special Adviser's records simply replicate existing information within the department, there may be no need to keep them as part of the official record.

The guidance also acknowledges the need to comply with various legal frameworks, including the Public Records Act 1958, the Freedom of Information Act 2000, the Data Protection Act 1998, the Environmental Information Regulations 2004, and the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988. It underscores that the management of records in Private Offices should align with these legal requirements and should be subject to ongoing review to adapt to evolving departmental electronic systems.

In summary, this guidance provides a comprehensive approach to the management of records in Private Offices, ensuring that all information is handled in a manner that maintains transparency, accountability, and legal compliance while supporting effective governance.


The text outlines the obligations of UK public authorities under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) 2000, the Environmental Information Regulations (EIRs) 2004, and the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988. It emphasizes that Private Offices within these departments must adhere to their department's records management policies and practices, which should include specific procedures tailored to the functions of Private Offices. These practices are guided by a Code of Practice under Section 46 of FOIA and aim to ensure the integrity and availability of information.

The purpose of robust records and information management is multifaceted: it ensures that records are easily retrievable for evidence in inquiries, reduces risks in litigation, maintains accountability with an audit trail, preserves records for historical and research purposes, and protects valuable information resources.

The guidance applies to a wide range of records within Private Offices, including correspondence with Ministers and officials from other departments, submissions from policy areas, annotated documents by Ministers, communications from Private Secretaries, official business correspondence, Cabinet documents (with separate guidance), official diaries, records of meetings with interest groups or lobbyists, instant messaging discussions, and notebooks kept by Private Secretaries and Ministers.

Crucially, the guidance excludes any constituency and party political records, as well as personal interests' records, which should be managed separately according to the wishes of the Minister and are outside the scope of this specific FOIA guidance.

In summary, the text sets out the importance of comprehensive records management within Private Offices of UK public authorities to comply with information access legislation and to maintain transparency, accountability, and legal integrity. It clarifies the types of records that fall under this mandate and those that are kept separate due to their personal nature.


 The text outlines a comprehensive policy for the recording of events involving Ministers and officials within the government. It distinguishes between formal and informal interactions, stipulating that official records should be created for significant events or meetings where decisions on departmental or government policy are made, or where actions are required post-meeting, especially if the views expressed would benefit those who were not present. The text specifically mentions:

- Ministerial diaries must reflect actual appointments and are considered public records.
- Responses from Ministers on official business should be documented.
- Official meetings between various stakeholders, including other Ministers, officials (including Special Advisers), different government departments, dignitaries, lobby groups, MPs (outside party politics), and private sector organizations must be recorded.
- Communication such as telephone conversations, instant messaging, and text discussions of an official nature should also be documented.

However, the policy acknowledges that not all interactions need to be recorded. Informal or social events, such as regular management meetings, briefing sessions for Parliamentary Questions, internal discussions for idea development, party political meetings or conversations, immediate actions leading to press statements, goodwill visits, and presentations/seminars where no policy decisions are made, do not require formal recording.

Additionally, the text highlights special categories of records that should be managed carefully, including Ministers' official diaries, records of formal meetings with outside interest groups or lobbyists, Private Secretaries' notes, exclusively internal papers of the Private Office, and declined invitations. These records are to be preserved in accordance with guidance from Sir Robin Butler and relevant legislation, ensuring their status as public records. The text references the government's response to recommendations by the Committee on Standards in Public Life, emphasizing the importance of transparency and accountability in recording formal interactions.


 The text outlines guidelines for managing records within Private Offices in alignment with the recommendations of the Sixth Report of the Committee on Standards in Public Life (Cmd 4817). It emphasizes the importance of agreeing upon retention periods for different types of records with the Deputy Record Keeper (DRO) and provides specific instructions for handling various categories of documents:

1. **Sensitive Papers**: These should be transferred to the DRO at an agreed time, with exceptions for highly sensitive materials where Ministers' annotations or comments may not be disseminated widely. In such cases, a Private Secretary note should be sent to record any necessary action, and the original paper kept in the Private Office. These records should later be passed to the DRO and then destroyed after an agreed period.

2. **Registered Files**: Some Private Offices may need to keep registered files, either electronically or on paper, particularly on subjects not directly supported by the department.

3. **Declined Invitations**: These should be kept for a period agreed with the DRO and then destroyed.

4. **Private Secretaries' Notebooks**: These are not public records and should be destroyed after six months. Any important information should be transferred to the official record beforehand, as they may be subject to access to information requests while in existence.

5. **Ministers' Notebooks**: These should be retained and handed over to the DRO at the end of the Minister's tenure. Ministers should be reminded that these notebooks are public records and can be presented as evidence in an Inquiry, as advised by Sir Richard Wilson in his letter of 16 December 1999. They may also be subject to access to information requests.

6. **Copies (and collections) of outgoing correspondence relating to official business**: These should be destroyed at a time agreed with the DRO.

The text also recommends best practice models for managing Private Office records, which have been effective in many departments. It advises adapting these models to fit the specific needs of each department's business operations while ensuring that the policy story can be reconstructed for accountability purposes. It highlights the importance of maintaining an audit trail that includes both electronic and paper elements, regardless of whether information is stored in an Electronic Records Management (ERM) system or on a digital network. The recommendation is that all Private Offices should ideally follow one of these best practice models, with the agreement of the DRO to ensure records are managed appropriately.

In summary, the text sets out clear directives and best practices for the management and disposal of various types of records within Private Offices, with a focus on transparency, accountability, and compliance with public standards.


 The text outlines two models for record management within a government department, with a focus on ensuring accountability and risk management in the decision-making process.

Model 1 is the recommended approach, which emphasizes that Private Offices (which support Ministers and senior officials) and policy areas each retain their own records for evidence of decision-making processes and knowledge management. This model is advocated for its risk management benefits, as it clarifies responsibility for managing risks associated with recordkeeping. It is crucial for the reputation of Ministers and Permanent Secretaries that all key information is readily available when needed. In this model, both Private Offices and policy areas must ensure that records are properly captured and stored in the departmental records system. The Private Office is responsible for updating policy areas with any comments or annotations made on submissions and ensuring that these updates are conveyed either electronically or as hard copies. If a Minister examines a submission without making comments, the Private Office should note this action. The Private Office determines, in consultation with the Deputy Registrar of Offices (DRO), whether to retain original annotated submissions or return them to policy areas.

The Private Office must maintain a record of all actions and comments related to electronic or paper submissions and electronically transmit responses and required actions back to the policy area, which is then responsible for compiling the full record in the electronic corporate file plan. Any records held by the Private Office that are not captured in the departmental records system should be transferred to the DRO, especially upon a change of Administration.

Model 2 delegates the responsibility of ensuring that all records are stored in the departmental record system to the policy areas, including both electronic and paper elements, which must be brought together in the corporate filing system. Under this model, the Private Office does not need to capture these records into the departmental records system but should ensure that comments or annotations are communicated to the policy area responsible for the record.

In both models, it is crucial that the DRO is responsible for weeding or disposing of records, as private offices should not dispose of potentially important documents. These models aim to ensure transparency, accountability, and the preservation of evidence in the decision-making process within government departments.


 The text outlines a records management and disposal schedule for Private Offices within a government department, emphasizing the importance of consistent and reliable record management practices across different policy areas and departments when there is cross-departmental work. It specifies how various types of records, including Minister's Notebooks, Engagement Diaries, Files of Correspondence, outgoing material, and digital assets like emails and documents on shared drives or personal devices, should be managed and disposed of.
Key points include:

- Private Offices must ensure that the record management procedures in all relevant policy areas are robust to maintain high standards and reputation.
- Minister's Notebooks should be passed to the Departmental Records Office (DRO) at the end of the Minister's tenure.
- Engagement Diaries, whether on paper or electronic form, should be reviewed annually or at the end of the Minister's tenure and then passed to the DRO.
- Files of correspondence, both paper and electronic, should be captured for permanent preservation at agreed intervals or when published web content, with hard copies stored in Registered folders and electronic versions passed to the DRO upon the end of the Minister's tenure.
- Outgoing material such as invitations and emails (with attachments, whether accepted or declined) should be retained for a predetermined retention period and then disposed of, with agreement on the specific period between the office and the DRO.

The text also provides guidance on where to find further advice on related matters, including various codes of conduct and directories of Civil Service Guidance, such as the Ministerial Code, General Election Guidance, and the Code of Conduct for Special Advisers. It concludes by noting that this guidance will be updated regularly and that specific disposal schedules can be found in an EXAMPLE PRIVATE OFFICE RECORDS MANAGEMENT DISPOSAL SCHEDULE provided by The National Archives (TNA).

For any additional questions or advice on the matters covered in this guidance, TNA can be contacted.


 The text outlines a comprehensive records management strategy for a government department, detailing how various types of information should be captured, stored, and preserved. Here's a summary:

1. **Events Documentation**: The department uses multiple platforms to share and store events-related information, including Electronic Records Management (ERM) systems, shared drives, personal drives, email, USB sticks, and palm-top devices. Regular gatherings are held to ensure all event-related content is documented and accessible.

2. **Web Content Management**: The department publishes content on official websites and web services like Flickr and YouTube. This content should be reviewed and updated every 6-12 months, with older content being destroyed after 6 months. Material from non-departmental sites should also be captured and passed to the Departmental Records Officer (DRO) at agreed intervals.

3. **Briefing Papers**: Both paper and electronic versions of briefing papers are kept, especially those related to Ministerial briefings. Registered files for such briefings must be preserved. Electronic versions should be stored on ERM or shared drives, personal drives, email, USB sticks, or palm-top devices.

4. **Wikis, Blogs, and Social Media**: The department uses web 2.0 content on official and Permanent Secretary, Chief unofficial government sites for internal communication. This includes wikis, blogs, social networking updates, and instant messaging. These records can be in both published formats and as official internal communications. They should also be passed to the DRO at agreed intervals for permanent preservation.

5. **Minutes of Meetings**: Both paper and electronic versions of meeting minutes, especially from formal meetings with policy implications or outside interest groups/lobbyists, are captured and stored. These should be passed to the DRO after the meeting or within a year, depending on the retention agreement.

6. **Non-Fixed Information Exchange Methods**: The department records information exchanged through telephone calls (including significant ones), live web feeds, and web chats with the Minister, among others. Email is a key method for this, and float copies should be retained. The retention period for these records must be agreed upon with the DRO.

7. **Private Office - Model 1**: This model emphasizes that all records, whether kept in paper or electronic form, should eventually be transferred to the departmental records system and then passed to the DRO at an agreed time for appropriate retention.

Throughout the document, there is a consistent theme of ensuring that all records are captured in a manner that is compliant with the department's records management policy, with a clear emphasis on transparency, accountability, and the preservation of information for future reference or legal compliance. The DRO plays a critical role in overseeing the retention and disposition of these records.


 The text outlines a comprehensive approach to records management within a government's Private Office, specifically under a model referred to as Model 2, which handles policy-related matters. The key points include:

1. **Records Management Practices**: All communications and briefings should be accurately documented, including Binet meetings, meetings on substantive issues, telephone conversations, instant messaging, oral briefings, records of discussions on web forums, and the Minister's official diaries. These records are crucial for reconstructing policy narratives to demonstrate accountability.

2. **Storage and Retention**: All records related to policy areas must be stored in the departmental records system. Any copies of records kept for administrative convenience should be either sent to the Departmental Records Officer (DRO) or securely destroyed after a period agreed upon with the DRO.

3. **Incoming Material**: Private Offices receive various materials, including correspondence from outside the department, submissions from policy areas, documents related to a Minister's responsibilities that require a response or decision, and records of communications on substantive issues. Oral briefings, discussions via instant messaging, and discussions on web forums also come into the Private Office.

4. **Outgoing Material**: The Private Office sends out correspondence, submissions annotated by a Minister without comment, documents that include responses or decisions related to a Minister's responsibilities, and safekeeping of matters dealt with exclusively within the Private Office. Cabinet materials are handled in accordance with instructions, and meeting notes are made concerning substantive issues. Records of telephone conversations, instant messaging, oral briefings, and discussions on web forums are also sent from the Private Office. The Minister's official diaries should be corrected to reflect actual appointments that took place.

5. **Accountability**: Good records management is emphasized to ensure that all policy processes can be accurately traced and reconstructed, which is essential for maintaining accountability within the government.

6. **Supplementary Guidance**: The provided "handy hints" are meant to complement and not replace any other existing guidance related to the operation of Private Offices.

In summary, the text emphasizes the importance of meticulous records management in a government's Private Office, particularly for policy-related matters, to ensure transparency, accountability, and effective governance. It outlines specific practices for handling various types of communication and documents, both incoming and outgoing, and the necessity of adhering to established records retention protocols.
