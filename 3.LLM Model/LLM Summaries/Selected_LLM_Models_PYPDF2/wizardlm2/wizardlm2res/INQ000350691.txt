 The Welsh Government issued a statement on December 1, 2020, by Jane Hutt MS, Deputy Minister and Chief Whip, to mark the United Nations' International Day of Disabled People. The statement emphasizes the importance of promoting the rights and well-being of disabled people globally, particularly in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. The theme for 2020 is "Building Back Better: toward a disability-inclusive, accessible, and sustainable Post COVID -19 World."

The Deputy Minister acknowledges that the pandemic has exacerbated existing societal problems, including the impact on the mental well-being and lives of many disabled people due to isolation, disconnection, disrupted routines, and diminished services. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) data indicates that 68% of Covid-related deaths in Wales occurred within the disabled community, with a disproportionate number of learning disability-related deaths. This suggests that socioeconomic factors rather than impairment itself are often at the root of these disparities.

The Welsh Government has been working under the Social Model of Disability since 2002, recognizing that societal actions disable people, not their impairments. The statement calls for a shift in focus from mitigating disablist culture to directly addressing disablism itself. This involves identifying and removing barriers that prevent disabled people from contributing fully to society.

The Deputy Minister also supports the Minister for Housing and Local Government's consultation on establishing a new fund to support disabled candidates in the 2021 Senedd elections and the 2022 Local Government elections. This initiative aims to reduce barriers to participation in local democracy.

Furthermore, the statement highlights the importance of including disabled people in the economic recovery efforts in Wales. To this end, the Welsh Government is introducing Disabled People Employment Champions to ensure that disabled individuals have opportunities to contribute and participate fully in the economy.

Overall, the statement calls for positive action and inclusive approaches as Wales moves forward from the COVID-19 pandemic, with a commitment to improving the lives of disabled people and ensuring their voices are heard and represented in all areas of society.


 The text outlines various initiatives and support measures for disabled people in Wales, particularly in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. It discusses the creation of Disabled People Employment Champions who will assist employers to create a workforce that is inclusive and representative of all individuals. Additionally, a new toolkit titled 'A More Equal Wales: A Practical Guide for Employers employing Disabled People' will be introduced on the International Day of Disabled People.

The author, likely a government official or minister responsible for disability issues in Wales, mentions the importance of feedback from stakeholders and representatives of Disabled People's Organisations (DPOs) through the Disability Equality Forum. This forum has been instrumental in providing insights into how different communities have been affected by the pandemic and has helped shape policies to make life more equitable for disabled individuals.

The text also acknowledges the work of the Equality, Local Government and Communities Committee cross-party group on disabled people and the contributions of DPO members to the Welsh Government's Accessible Communication Group. These groups have ensured that the needs of disabled people are considered in communication and public space development during the pandemic.

Financial support for disability projects is highlighted, with Â£200,000 from the Welsh Government's Reserves for Reconstruction package being allocated to fund nine DPOs across Wales. This funding will help sustain the work of these organizations and provide critical information and advice to disabled individuals affected by COVID-19.

Furthermore, a project led by Professor Debbie Foster from Cardiff University has been initiated to study the impact of COVID on disabled people. Members of the Disability Equality Forum will collaborate with Professor Foster to gather data, evidence, and case studies. The findings are intended to refresh the "Action on Disability" framework that was launched in 2019, ensuring that Wales can quickly implement changes based on what has been learned during the pandemic.

The author invites all Members of the Senedd (Welsh Parliament) to join in celebrating the contribution of disabled people in Wales on the United Nations' International Day of Disabled People, emphasizing the importance of recognizing and supporting this community.
