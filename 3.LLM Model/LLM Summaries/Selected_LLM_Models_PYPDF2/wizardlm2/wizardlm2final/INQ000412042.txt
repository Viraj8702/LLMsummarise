Title: INQ000412042 - Presentation from UK Covid-19 Inquiry, titled module 2B data and charts, dated between 01/01/2020 and 01/04/2022.

 The text provides a detailed overview of the impact of Covid-19 on Wales from April 2020 to April 2022, based on data from various UK government sources such as the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) and the Office for National Statistics (ONS). Here's a summary:

1. **Covid-19 Daily Deaths**: The number of daily deaths involving Covid-19 in Wales peaked at 1,400 in April 2022 and had dropped to nearly zero by early 2023. This data is from the UKHSA Covid dashboard.

2. **Excess Weekly Deaths**: There were significant excess deaths in Wales during the pandemic, with weekly numbers peaking at around 600 in January 2021 and April 2022. These figures are above the five-year average (2015-19) and are reported by the ONS.

3. **Hospitalizations and Place of Death**: The majority of deaths involving Covid-19 occurred in hospitals, with a smaller percentage occurring in care homes, hospices, home settings, and other communal establishments. There was a notable increase of around 30% in deaths at home and a decrease of over 20% in hospital settings compared to usual levels from March 2020 to June 2022. These changes are reported in the ONS's Inquiry into Mortality and Morbidity (INQ).

4. **Cumulative Mortality**: For the years 2020-2022, there was a significant cumulative increase in mortality rates compared to the 2015-19 average, with the highest rates observed in February of each year.

5. **Estimated Covid-19 Infection Rates**: The ONS Covid Infection Survey shows that the percentage of the population testing positive for Covid-19 peaked at around 95% in May 2020 and declined over time, reaching near zero by early 2023. The survey provides credible intervals for its estimates.

6. **Weekly Mortality Rates**: The ONS reports that mortality rates were significantly higher than the 2015-19 average during the pandemic, particularly in January and February of each year from 2020 to 2022.

7. **Trends Over Time**: The data shows clear trends over time with peaks and troughs corresponding to different waves of the pandemic and the introduction and easing of public health measures and vaccination programs.

The text concludes by citing specific references for the data, including INQ000396876 for mortality details and the ONS Covid Infection Survey for infection rates. This summary provides a snapshot of the Covid-19 pandemic's impact on Wales's mortality statistics, hospitalizations, and infection rates over a two-year period.
