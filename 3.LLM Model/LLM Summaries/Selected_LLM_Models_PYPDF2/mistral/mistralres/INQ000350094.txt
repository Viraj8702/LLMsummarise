 The text is a series of emails discussing the restrictions during COVID-19 Tier 4, specifically focusing on leisure and fitness facilities (gyms, swimming pools, spas, fitness studios) and supermarkets. It appears that gyms will be closed in Tier 4, while supermarkets will remain open but may have restrictions on the sale of non-essential items, although clarification is still awaited. The emails also mention decisions made on unlicensed music events, penalties for businesses failing to comply with terms of a Premises Improvement Notice, and an oversight in communication these decisions to other ministers. The Private Secretary (Lee Waters) is seeking help or advice regarding updates on these topics.


 The text provides a summary of changes to regulations and penalties related to the COVID-19 pandemic in Wales, as reflected in communications from James Gerard, Deputy Director of Justice Transformation and Devolution at the Office of the First Minister.

Here are some key updates:

1. Failure to self-isolate after international travel will now result in a reduced Fixed Penalty Notice (FPN) value of £500 (initially, increasing on subsequent occasions). This change comes into effect on Saturday morning.

2. Organizing an event with over 15 people indoors or over 30 people outdoors will now result in an increased FPN value of £500 (initially, increasing on subsequent occasions), to be included in next week's regulations introducing the "traffic lights" system.

3. The penalty for international travel operators failing to provide information to travellers has been reduced from a fixed £4000 to an initial £1000, rising on subsequent occasions. This change will also take effect on Saturday morning.

4. There was no consensus to create a further offence for "reckless" breaches of general self-isolation requirements, despite suggestions that it might work better in England. Further discussions and testing with stakeholders are proposed.

5. Ministers aim to conduct a systematic review to ensure clarity about the respective roles and responsibilities of enforcing authorities and have agreed to engage all enforcing authorities to assess the seriousness of COVID-related offenses and match the law enforcement response accordingly.

6. A previous proposal to retain a £1 fine for unlicensed music events was upheld by Gerard, as it addresses deterrent needs of police while ensuring access to justice requirements are met. A similar approach has been taken in other MA (Marches and Anglesey) advice documents.


 The text discusses changes proposed for Fixed Penalty Notices (FPNs) in response to COVID-19 restrictions. The author, Irrelevant & Sensitive, suggests increasing the penalty for failing to self-isolate after international travel from £200 to £500, aligning it with Scottish levels. They also recommend a uniform increase in the penalty for organizing an event over 15 people indoors or over 30 people outdoors (house parties offense), also to £500.

The advantages of these changes include creating consistency across penalties and addressing ongoing concerns about house parties, particularly among under-25s, which are increasing during evenings when pubs are closed. The recommendations will be discussed further with the First Minister before being implemented. Other comments on the FPN review were positive, with the Minister for Housing and Local Government find the recommendations proportionate, and some concerns expressed regarding unlicensed music events remaining at a £10,000 FPN. A further update is pending from the First Minister on these issues.


 The text pertains to several matters under discussion in the Welsh Government, specifically focused on issues related to court penalties, police views, and post-firebreak restrictions following a COVID-19 review.

1. There is debate about addressing courts level penalties, with questions posed whether such resolution would impact the perspectives of local police. It's unclear from the text if this issue will be postponed or pursued further.

2. Proposals other than those regarding court level penalties seem less contentious but it is preferred that Ministers have an opportunity to express their thoughts before moving forward.

3. Private offices are asked to confirm whether Ministers have considered the review of FPN's (Fixed Penalty Notices) in document 5 and send any comments as soon as possible, with a final decision expected on Monday by the First Minister.

4. The text contains advice for the First Minister concerning the first review of post-firebreak restrictions due to COVID-19, including the upcoming release of a statement from the Chief Medical Officer. A Welsh translation of the draft Written Statement will be provided tomorrow (Presumably the day after this message was sent).
