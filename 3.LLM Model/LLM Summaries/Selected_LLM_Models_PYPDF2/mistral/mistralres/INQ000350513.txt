 The text presents a proposed strategy to combat the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic in the UK, as outlined by Rob. This approach involves immediate containment of the disease within households, achieved through the closure of all non-essential businesses and restricting outings to essential food shopping or urgent business for one individual per household. Household contact should also be minimized, with increased attention given to hand-washing and surface cleaning.

The strategy aims for a short period (4-8 weeks) of intense containment, during which new hospital admissions from Wales must drop below 5 per day, and a community testing and control method needs to be put in place. Public awareness should be raised about the gravity of the situation and their role in stopping the spread of the virus. The plan includes reverting to traditional methods for dealing with communicable disease outbreaks on a larger scale with a faster pace, although it suggests that this approach will be challenging.

Chris, who appears to hold a high-ranking position within the Department of Health and Social Care, shares this strategy as a draft, asking the recipients not to distribute it yet, as it has not been fully cleared.
