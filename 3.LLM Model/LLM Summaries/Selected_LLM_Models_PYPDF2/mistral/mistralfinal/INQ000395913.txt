Title: INQ000395913 - Email chain between Dr Rob Orford (Chief Scientific Adviser for Health, Welsh Government), Reg Kilpatrick (Director General, Covid Crisis Coordination, Welsh Government) and colleagues, regarding Covid fire break, dated between 15/10/2020 and 18/10/2020.

 This text is an exchange of emails between Reg Kilpatrick, Director General of Covid Crisis Coordination in the Welsh Government, and Huw Morris, Director of Skills, Higher Education and Lifelong Learning in the Welsh Government. The main points discussed in the emails are as follows:

1. They discuss the need for more testing and contact tracing to prevent the spread of COVID-19. It was mentioned that a significant percentage (60-80%) of people who should be isolating or quarantining are not, which is contributing to the spread of the virus. The discussion also included the idea of incentivizing self-isolation through financial rewards, which is currently in progress but needs to be implemented quickly.
2. Huw Morris suggests that a firebreak (a temporary lockdown) won't work effectively without wider and more regular testing of people, whether symptomatic or not. This approach has been adopted by several universities. He also mentions the importance of paying people to isolate, with Independent SAGE recommending up to Â£400 per week.
3. They discuss the need for a detailed economic argument to understand the impact of their policies on businesses, particularly in retail. They are facing pressure from these businesses who question the basis for the decision to ask them to close and want to see evidence for it.
4. Reg Kilpatrick expresses his desire for a balanced discussion on the potential harms of their decisions as there are no good answers, every option causes harm. But ultimately, they understand that a decision needs to be made based on the information available to them from a public health perspective.
5. They welcome any private views from experts on this exchange when they have a moment.


 The text contains a discussion among high-ranking officials about the potential impacts of a firebreak, a temporary nationwide lockdown aimed at curbing the spread of the coronavirus. They are expressing concerns about the economic costs and social harms of the firebreak, particularly its impact on lower-income workers and long-term negative effects on individuals and the economy as a whole. Some estimates suggest that the firebreak could reduce GDP by up to 5%. The authors emphasize that while it is crucial to save lives during the pandemic, they need to be aware of and candid about the significant economic and social costs associated with such measures.


 The text consists of two emails related to the COVID-19 project team of the Welsh Government (Llywodraeth Cymru).

In the first email, Tom Smithson requests that the colleagues draft papers on legal advice regarding a firebreak policy for Cabinet consideration by 11 am the next day. He's open to focused tracked changes, particularly for correcting errors, but not for Annex B and C due to previous discussions and numerous different issues. Feedback should be digestible and provided by 10:30 am.

In the second email, Tom shares a paper summarizing the points needing resolution in connection with the firebreak policy. He asks for clarifications or adjustments until Saturday morning, and the final version needs to be submitted before the end of the morning for an afternoon discussion at 2:30 pm. Amends are required by around 1 am.

The primary subject matter relates to resolving issues for a firebreak policy decision in the Welsh Government's Cabinet meeting, including ensuring business support arrangements, clarity about the post-firebreak regime, and defining what the two weeks of a firebreak will be used for.


 The summary of the text is as follows:

Tom Smithson from the COVID-19 Project Team of Welsh Government held a meeting on October 16, 2020. During the meeting, several areas of discussion were highlighted where further work and advice are needed. These include secondary schools, outdoor activities, local government decisions on amenities and transport capacity.

Regarding secondary schools, discussions need to be initiated for an approach during week 2 of the firebreak regarding school attendance and exams, particularly for resits which can potentially be delayed, but not others like medical/vet or Oxbridge entry exams.

For outdoor activities, it's yet to be decided whether to limit gatherings outdoors beyond the 30-person limit or allow any organized activity such as Halloween, Guy Fawkes night, and Remembrance Sunday which all fall within this period. Consultations are also needed for local government on their approach to amenities like playgrounds and whether they should be kept open by appointment only.

Lastly, decisions need to be made regarding transport capacity during the firebreak. New issues that were not discussed in the first lockdown include considering the approach to industries such as manufacturing, construction, offices, etc., how hotels can open for certain guests (e.g., homeless or for key workers), and whether people working in England have a reasonable excuse to travel if their employers require it. These new issues are being picked up by someone named Liz for further consideration.
