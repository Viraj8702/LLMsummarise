Title: INQ000383585 - Email from DHSC colleague to Sir Frank Atherton (Chief Medical Officer for Wales), Professor Chris Whitty (Chief Medical Officer for England), Catherine Calderwood (Chief Medical Officer for Northern Ireland) and Michael McBride (Chief Medical Officer for Nothern Ireland) regarding CMO Coronavirus briefing for DsPH, dated 05/02/2020.

 The text is a summary of a conference call between the Chief Medical Officer (CMO) and Directors of Public Health (DsPH) in the UK, which took place on January 31, 2020. The CMO provided an update on the epidemiology of the coronavirus outbreak, discussing two possible scenarios, one involving a transition from containment to mitigation, but clarifying that this is not the current situation. The meeting also covered planning for mitigation using pandemic flu as a model, and discussed changes to geographical and clinical case definitions related to returning flights from China.

The Deputy Chief Medical Officer (DCMO) took over the call and addressed concerns about communication strategy. Specifically, the need for appropriate communications in different listening environments, addressing groups like universities, boarding schools, and the Chinese community in the UK, as well as maintaining community cohesion. The DCMO also agreed to share information from the call via email and pick up on specific requests related to quarantine measures in the North East and housing of repatriated individuals.

The text also includes administrative details regarding the email's intended recipient, confidentiality, and the non-permanent storage policy by the Chief Medical Officer's Private Office.
