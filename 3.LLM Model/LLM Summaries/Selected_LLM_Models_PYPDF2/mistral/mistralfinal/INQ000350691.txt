Title: INQ000350691 - Statement by Jane Hutt (Deputy First Minister) and Welsh Government, titled Statement to mark the International Day of Disabled People, dated 01/12/2020.

 The Welsh Government issued a statement marking the International Day of Disabled People on December 1, 2020. The UN has designated this day since 1992 to promote the rights and well-being of disabled people globally. This year's theme is "Building Back Better: toward a disability-inclusive, accessible, and sustainable Post COVID-19 World."

Jane Hutt MS, Deputy Minister and Chief Whip, highlighted that the pandemic has been particularly devastating for the disabled community in Wales, with 68% of Covid-related deaths coming from this group. She emphasized the need to reduce barriers for disabled people's contributions and to integrate disability inclusivity into all government policies.

Hutt also announced the Welsh Government's support for a new fund to provide financial support to disabled individuals seeking elected office in the 2021 Senedd elections and the 2022 Local Government elections, with the intention of encouraging more disabled candidates and amplifying their voices within society. The statement concludes by recognizing that disabled people play an essential role in economic recovery efforts in Wales.


 The text discusses the announcement and efforts made by the Welsh government towards creating a more inclusive workforce for individuals with disabilities. This will be facilitated through the appointment of Disabled People Employment Champions, who will guide employers across Wales in fostering a diverse work environment.

A new tool-kit named "A More Equal Wales: A Practical Guide for Employers employing Disabled People" will also be launched to assist employers. The kit is planned for release on the International Day of Disabled People, which coincides with its launch date this Thursday.

The government consulted representatives from Disabled People's Organisations and various stakeholders through the Disability Equality Forum to better understand the impact of the pandemic on diverse communities. The forum has been instrumental in informing the Welsh Government about the challenges faced by communities during the Covid-19 pandemic, such as accessing information or participating in public spaces.

Additionally, Â£200,000 from the Welsh Government's Reserves for Reconstruction package will be allocated to fund disability projects throughout Wales, supporting organizations that represent individuals with disabilities. Moreover, a project led by Professor Debbie Foster from Cardiff University has been initiated to generate a report on the impact of COVID-19 on disabled people in Wales. Members of the Disability Equality Forum will collaborate with Professor Foster in gathering data and insights for the report.

The report's findings are intended to update and improve the "Action on Disability" framework launched by the government in 2019, enabling swift action in addressing pandemic-related learning opportunities. The Welsh government invites all members of the Senedd (Welsh Parliament) to celebrate the important work being done for disabled people on the United Nation's International Day of Disabled People.
