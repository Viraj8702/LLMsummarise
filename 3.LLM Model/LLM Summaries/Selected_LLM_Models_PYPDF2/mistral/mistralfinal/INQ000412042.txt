5. Age-standardized weekly mortality rates were significantly higher than the 2015-19 average during peak periods but returned to normal afterwards. (Data source: ONS, age standardized mortality rates)

6. The estimated percentage of the population testing positive for COVID-19 also increased significantly in waves from May 2020 to February 2021, reaching as high as 95%, and then decreased thereafter. (Data source: ONS Covid Infection Survey)
