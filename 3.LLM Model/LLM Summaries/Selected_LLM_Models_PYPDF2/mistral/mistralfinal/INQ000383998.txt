Title: INQ000383998 - Email chain between Dr Rob Orford (Chief Scientific Adviser for Health, Welsh Government), PS Minister of Health and Social Services and colleagues, regarding Welsh National COVID 19 Test Plan, dated 27/03/2020.

 Rob has provided answers to some questions posed by the Minister regarding the implementation of the Welsh COVID-19 testing plan, which includes orders for equipment and testing reagents. The Minister has expressed concerns about the reliability of certain equipment providers like Roche and has asked if there are contingency plans or additional options, such as collaborative projects with universities and other pharmaceuticals companies.

The test numbers provided in the plan include increased capacity in Wales, that is not reliant on UK initiatives and do not depend on Boots/Amazon as a fallback. The testing capacity will be gradually increased, starting at 500 tests per day currently, going up to 1900 per day by mid-April, 3000 daily by the end of April, and further increasing through early May.

The Minister has also mentioned that there is data linking that positions Wales better than other UK nations in terms of COVID-19 testing, and the positive findings should be highlighted in a press release. Furthermore, the Minister agrees to drive power from their national health database SAIL and encourages the publication of a decision report regarding agreement on the Wales COVID-19 testing plan.
