Title: INQ000385719 - Email chain between Rob Orford (Chief Scientific Adviser for Health, Welsh Government), Frank Atherton (Chief Medical Officer for Wales), Tracey Cooper (Chief Executive of Public Health Wales) and colleagues, regarding PHW/WG - National assessment, dated between 10/11/2020 and 11/10/2020.

 Summary: The text is a preparatory note for an upcoming meeting discussing the strategy for controlling COVID-19 in Wales. The key points of discussion are:

1. Key Strategic Intent: Discuss options for the Welsh strategy, focusing on either aiming for elimination (with considerations for collateral damage such as economy, jobs, and education) or setting an acceptable baseline endemicity and protecting vulnerable groups under this strategy.

2. Current and Future Picture: The text suggests that the case incidence, associated hospital admissions, deaths, outbreaks in healthcare settings/care homes, and university outbreaks will continue to rise if current trends persist.

3. Global Experience Suggestions: Countries with successful COVID-19 suppression strategies have shown that maintaining very stringent border control (e.g., stopping non-essential travel and enforcing quarantine), a highly functional test, trace, and isolate program, financial incentives for people needing to isolate, and capacity to handle large numbers of cases and contacts are key factors in their success.

4. Options and Timing: The text invites discussion on whether to continue with the current local and hyper-local lockdowns or implement additional national interventions (should these be enacted, when, and for how long?) and what strategies might be considered for the longer term.

The meeting is scheduled for October 11th on Microsoft Teams at 2:00 - 3:00 PM UTC+00:00. The attendees include Huw, Giri, and possibly Tracey based on her email message.
