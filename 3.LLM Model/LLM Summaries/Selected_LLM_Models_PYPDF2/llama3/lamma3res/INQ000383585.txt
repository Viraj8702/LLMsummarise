The text appears to be a summary email from the Chief Medical Officer (CMO) to the Directors of Public Health (DsPH) in the UK. The CMO had briefed them earlier on the current epidemiology of the COVID-19 outbreak and discussed two scenarios: containment and mitigation. The CMO confirmed that they were using the pandemic flu model for reasonable worst-case scenario planning.

The email also mentions a Q&A session, where the CMO:

* Confirmed that the pandemic flu model was being used
* Stated that it's unclear if surviving infection protects against re-infection
* Agreed to seek advice from NERVTAG (Neuropathology and Neuroinfections Committee) on treatment options
* Acknowledged that planning for mitigation is wise

The email also mentions updates on a plane bringing people back from China, changes to geographical case definition, and clinical case definition. The Director of Communicable Disease Control, Medical Officer (DCMO) took over as Chair and discussed communication strategies, emphasizing the need for clarity and sensitivity in messaging.

Finally, the email notes that this message will not be saved by CMO Private Office, and recipients should keep a copy if needed for audit purposes.
