Here's a summary of the text:

This document is an update from a meeting held on January 22, 2020, regarding the Wuhan Coronavirus (WN-CoV) outbreak. Key points include:

1. China has revised its case definitions, making comparisons difficult.
2. Diagnostic testing in Wuhan is overwhelmed, and there's uncertainty around the data.
3. WHO has received environmental sampling from Wuhan, which may provide information on the virus's zoonotic reservoir.

The document also provides an overview of the current understanding of WN-CoV:

1. Evidence of person-to-person transmission exists.
2. The incubation period is unclear, but appears to be 5-10 days.
3. The reproductive number is likely higher than 1.
4. The mortality rate is currently estimated to be lower than SARS, but it's too early to quantify.
5. No evidence on the genetic strain or origin of the virus exists yet.

Finally, the document summarizes the conclusions from NERVTAG (an advisory group):

1. Port of entry screening is not advised due to limited understanding of epidemiology.
2. Public health information efforts via leaflets, posters, and broadcast messengers are supported.
3. Temperature and other forms of screening are not recommended.

The UK's readiness and planning for WN-CoV include:

1. Good centralized diagnostic capacity exists, with a specific test scalable across the UK in weeks.
2. The sensitivity of the test is currently unknown.


Here is a summary of the text:

The UK government has been working with experts to respond to the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan, China. The report discusses various aspects of the response, including:

* Testing and detection of cases: The sensitivity of diagnostic tests is unknown, and there are conflicting reports from upper respiratory tract sampling.
* Criteria for testing potentially infected individuals: The government's health and safety agencies have developed criteria for identifying potential cases, which include symptoms, signs of WN-CoV, and a history of travel to or living in Wuhan.
* Isolation and contact tracing: Plans are being prepared to isolate potentially infected individuals and trace their contacts.
* Communication and messaging: Consistent messages should be conveyed on travel advice to/from Wuhan, and uncertainty should be communicated clearly.

The report also notes that there are no practical preventative actions that can be taken ahead of Chinese New Year. The government has established triggers for escalating the response, including:

* Infection of healthcare workers
* Sustained human-to-human transmission outside of Wuhan
* Severe confirmed case in the UK

If these triggers are met, the government's response will review and adapt accordingly.

Finally, the report lists various actions to be taken, including:

* Sharing the latest isolation plan with behavioral scientists for improvement
* Considering how NHS primary care facilities might respond to an increase of cases and potential cases
* Coordinating consistent messaging on travel advice with FCO
