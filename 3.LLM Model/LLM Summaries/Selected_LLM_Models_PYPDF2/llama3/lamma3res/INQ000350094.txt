Here is a summary of the email chain:

The email chain appears to be between officials in the Welsh government, specifically Lee Waters, Deputy Minister for Economy and Transport.

The first email is from someone other than Lee Waters, asking for clarification on non-essential items being sold in Tier 4. They mention that supermarkets are considered essential but may not be able to sell certain items.

Lee Waters' office responds, stating that they will need to wait for further clarification on this point. The rest of the email chain is an internal discussion about reviewing restrictions post-firebreak and follows up on previous decisions made by the FM (First Minister).

The key points discussed are:

1. Leisure and fitness facilities will be closed in Tier 4.
2. Supermarkets can remain open, but may not be able to sell non-essential items in Tier 4 (pending clarification).
3. There have been updates on unlicenced music events and penalties for businesses that fail to comply with premises improvement notices.

Overall, the email chain appears to be an internal review and update process within the Welsh government regarding restrictions and policies related to COVID-19.


The email appears to be from James Gerard, Deputy Director of the Welsh Government's Office of the First Minister, summarizing the views of the Chief Governance's Officer (CG) on several matters related to COVID-19 regulations.

Specifically:

* The CG has agreed to reduce the fixed penalty notice (FPN) value for failure to self-isolate following international travel from £1000 to an initial £500, which will rise on subsequent occasions.
* The FPN value for organizing events with over 15 people indoors or 30 people outdoors ("house parties" offence) will increase from an initial £200 to an initial £500, rising on subsequent occasions.
* The CG has agreed to reduce the penalty for international travel operators failing to provide information to travelers from a fixed £4000 to an initial £1000, rising on subsequent occasions.
* The CG was not convinced by arguments against creating a new offence for "reckless" breaches of self-isolation requirements and suggested that police officers must be trained to handle such cases.
* Ministers have agreed to conduct a systematic review to ensure clarity about the roles and responsibilities of enforcing authorities and to discuss with all authorities which offenses are most serious in the COVID-19 context.

The email also mentions that officials had been discussing these matters with the CG throughout the week.


Here's a summary of the text:

The writer has been asked to review the Fixed Penalty Notices (FPNs) for certain offenses, such as failing to self-isolate after international travel and organizing indoor or outdoor events with more than 15-30 people. The reviewer suggested increasing the fines for these offenses to £500, to align with Scottish levels. This would simplify the penalty structure into two categories: one starting at £60 for most offenses, and another starting at £500 for more serious offenses.

The key points are:

* The First Minister has agreed to retain current restrictions and approved a draft Written Statement.
* However, the First Minister is not willing to agree with proposed amendments to FPNs without further discussion.
* The suggestions were made by the Chief Government (CG) advisor, who suggested increasing fines for failing to self-isolate after international travel and organizing large events.

Overall, the review was seeking to simplify and align penalty structures, but the First Minister has asked for more information and consultation before making a decision.


The text is an internal communication within the Welsh Government regarding a proposal related to fixed penalty notices (FPNs) for traffic offenses. The First Minister wants to make a final decision on Monday, and is seeking comments from Ministerial colleagues before proceeding.

Two main points are mentioned:

1. The issue of court-level penalties being awarded needs to be addressed; if not, it may affect the views of police officers.
2. There are other proposals that seem less contentious, but the First Minister wants Ministers to have an opportunity to comment on these as well.

The document also references a review of FPNs and notes that advice for the First Minister will follow, including a statement from the Chief Medical Officer and a Welsh translation of a draft written statement.
