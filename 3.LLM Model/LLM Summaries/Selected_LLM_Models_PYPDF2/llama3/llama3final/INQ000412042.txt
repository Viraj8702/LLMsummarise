Title: INQ000412042 - Presentation from UK Covid-19 Inquiry, titled module 2B data and charts, dated between 01/01/2020 and 01/04/2022.

This text appears to be a dashboard or report on COVID-19 data for Wales, UK, as of February 6th, 2024. The data includes:

1. Daily deaths with COVID-19 on the death certificate: This shows a steady decline from an initial peak in April 2020 to around 20 cases per day by July 2022.
2. Excess weekly deaths: There is a slight fluctuation over time, but generally, the excess deaths (above the five-year average) have decreased since March 2021.
3. Weekly COVID-19 patients in hospital: This shows a significant decline from an initial peak of around 30,000 cases per day to less than 10,000 by July 2022.
4. New cases of COVID-19 per day: The number of new cases has declined significantly since the initial peak in April 2020 to around 250 cases per day by December 2021.
5. Estimated percentage of the population testing positive for COVID-19: This shows a significant decline from an estimated 10% of the population testing positive in May 2020 to less than 2% by August 2020 and then stabilizing at around 2%-4%.
6. Age-specific death rates with COVID-19: The data shows that older age groups (75+ years) have been disproportionately affected.
7. Excess deaths by place of occurrence: This shows a higher percentage of excess deaths occurring in care homes rather than hospitals or hospices.

The report also includes cumulative mortality data for 2020-22 compared to the five-year average, which shows that Wales had an elevated death rate during this time period.
