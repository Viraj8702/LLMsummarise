Title: INQ000350513 - Email chain between Chris Whitty (Chief Medical Officer for England, UK Government), Frank Atherton (Chief Medical Officer, Welsh Government), Rob Orford (Chief Scientific Adviser for Health, Welsh Government) and colleagues, regarding an overview of UK Strategy, dated 22/03/2020.

The summary is from a meeting of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE) about COVID-19. It appears that two individuals, Rob and Chris, are discussing a proposal to combat the spread of the virus.

Rob suggests that instead of the current approach, which involves suppressing the growth of the virus through non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), a more refined approach is needed. He proposes a "short sharp period" of intense containment, including closing non-essential businesses and limiting social mixing to household contact only. This would be followed by a scaled and detailed community testing and control method.

Chris's email is a draft piece that sets out the strategic goal and tactical pillars for COVID-19 response, with a focus on informing No10 thinking. He proposes that the end-game should involve a combination of maximum short-term suppression and an aggressive but refined testing, isolation, and release strategy.

Both individuals emphasize the importance of quick action to contain the virus, citing concerns about the mutation rate and the need for future responses to be even more effective. They also highlight the potential consequences of inaction, including a swamped National Health Service (NHS) or prolonged suppression measures.
