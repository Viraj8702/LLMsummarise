Title: INQ000385719 - Email chain between Rob Orford (Chief Scientific Adviser for Health, Welsh Government), Frank Atherton (Chief Medical Officer for Wales), Tracey Cooper (Chief Executive of Public Health Wales) and colleagues, regarding PHW/WG - National assessment, dated between 10/11/2020 and 11/10/2020.

The text is an email from Giri ahead of a meeting with colleagues at 2pm. The email presents some key points to consider during the discussion, focusing on strategies for Wales regarding COVID-19.

The main points are:

1. Key strategic intent: options for dealing with COVID-19 in Wales, including aiming for elimination or setting an acceptable baseline endemicity level.
	* Consideration of the potential collateral damage from a strategy aiming for elimination (e.g., economy, jobs, interrupted education).
2. Current picture: expected rise in case incidence, hospital admissions, deaths, and outbreaks in healthcare settings, care homes, and universities by end-October.
3. Global experience: lessons learned from countries that have tried to eliminate COVID-19:
	+ Very stringent border control
	+ Highly functional test, trace, and isolate program with rapid testing and contact tracing
	+ Financial incentives for isolation and system capacity to deal with a significant number of new cases
	+ Clear messaging to communities about the roadmap and benefits of measures
4. Options and timing: considering whether to continue with local lockdowns or introduce additional national interventions.

The email aims to provide a starting point for the discussion and encourages Huw and Giri to prepare relevant information in advance.
