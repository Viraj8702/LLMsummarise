Title: INQ000395913 - Email chain between Dr Rob Orford (Chief Scientific Adviser for Health, Welsh Government), Reg Kilpatrick (Director General, Covid Crisis Coordination, Welsh Government) and colleagues, regarding Covid fire break, dated between 15/10/2020 and 18/10/2020.

The text is an exchange of emails between Reg Kilpatrick, Director General of Covid Crisis Coordination, Welsh Government, and Huw Morris, Director of Skills, Higher Education and Lifelong Learning, also from the Welsh Government.

In his email, Reg highlights the need for a different approach to testing and isolation to address the transmission of the virus. He notes that 60-80% of people are not self-isolating or quarantining, and that asymptomatic cases make up around 40% of all cases (although this figure may vary). He also mentions the need for financial rewards for those who isolate, which is currently in progress but delayed due to local authority requirements.

Huw responds, agreeing with Reg's points and emphasizing the importance of addressing the transmission of the virus. He suggests that wider, more regular testing of people - whether symptomatic or not - could help achieve this goal. He also recommends paying people to isolate, backed by increased policing for those who refuse to self-isolate.

Reg Kilpatrick sends a follow-up email to Andrew J and Tom, stating that the Welsh Government is under pressure from businesses in the retail sector to explain why they need to close during the firebreak period.


The email discusses the decision-making process surrounding a "firebreak" measure aimed at curbing the spread of COVID-19. Several individuals, including Andrew, Tom, and Emma, express concerns about the impact of this measure on the economy and individual livelihoods. They question the basis for the decision and request to see evidence supporting it.

Andrew specifically highlights the potential negative impacts on the economy, including a GDP reduction of up to 5%, supply chain disruptions, and long-term scarring effects, particularly for young people and disadvantaged groups. He argues that the enhanced Job Support Scheme (JSS) is less generous than the previous Job Retention Scheme (JRS), which means that individuals affected by the closure of sectors will suffer a bigger negative impact on their incomes.

The email concludes with Andrew suggesting that while the recommendation appears to be for a strict firebreak, it's essential to acknowledge the significant negative impacts this will have and the high price paid for the lives saved.


The text appears to be an email thread between individuals regarding a document titled "Firebreak Paper" related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The main points are:

* Tom Smithson is asking Helen and other colleagues to draft papers for Cabinet to consider, with a deadline of 11 am.
* Tom prefers tracked changes rather than lengthy comments, especially to correct mistakes or errors in the documents.
* Tom has reflected on the comments received so far and attached a paper summarizing the issues that need addressing.
* The Cabinet discussed the firebreak paper earlier today, agreeing on the principle subject to further reassurances on three areas:
	+ Business support arrangements are in place
	+ Clarity about what regime will follow the firebreak and how it will be communicated
	+ What will happen during the two-week period
* Tom has noted down the main points from the Cabinet discussion, including agreement on a shorter, sharper firebreak.


The summary is as follows:

A COVID-19 project team at the Welsh Government has identified several areas that require further work and advice:

1. Education: The team needs to decide on options for secondary schools during the firebreak, including what pupils can attend and how exams can be managed.
2. Outdoor activities: The team must determine whether to limit gatherings outdoors and allow organized activities like Halloween celebrations.
3. Local government: The team requires guidance on approaching amenities, playgrounds, and public transport capacity during the firebreak.
4. Sectors not closed in first lockdown: The team needs to consider reopening sectors that remained open during the initial lockdown, such as manufacturing, construction, and offices.

Additionally, new issues have arisen due to the stay-at-home steer, including:

1. Hotels: Should hotels be allowed to open for specific guests, such as the homeless or essential workers?
2. Work-related travel: Can people working in England reasonably travel if their employers require it?

Overall, there are several areas that require further discussion and decision-making by the COVID-19 project team at the Welsh Government.
