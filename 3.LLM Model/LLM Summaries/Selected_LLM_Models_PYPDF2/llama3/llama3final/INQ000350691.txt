Title: INQ000350691 - Statement by Jane Hutt (Deputy First Minister) and Welsh Government, titled Statement to mark the International Day of Disabled People, dated 01/12/2020.

Here is a summary of the statement:

The Welsh Government's Deputy Minister, Jane Hutt MS, marks the International Day of Disabled People on December 1st. She acknowledges that the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the existing problems and barriers faced by disabled people in society. According to ONS data, almost 7 in every 10 COVID-related deaths in Wales were from disabled communities. The government recognizes that these deaths were not solely due to impairment but were also rooted in socioeconomic factors.

The statement asserts the importance of addressing disablism and promoting disability-inclusive policies. It highlights the need to focus on identifying and removing barriers to disabled people's contributions, rather than just mitigating the effects of disablist culture.

The government is taking proactive steps to increase disabled representation in local democracy. A new fund will be established to support disabled individuals in seeking elected office for the 2021 Senedd elections and 2022 Local Government elections.

Overall, the statement emphasizes the importance of building a more inclusive society that values the contributions of disabled people and promotes their well-being and participation.


The text is from an address by a government official, likely the Minister for Equalities, Local Government and Communities in Wales. The official reflects on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on disabled people in Wales and announces several initiatives to support them.

In particular:

* A new toolkit will be launched to help employers across Wales create a representative workforce.
* "Disabled People Employment Champions" will support these efforts.
* Â£200,000 from the Welsh Government's Reserves for Reconstruction package will be allocated to fund disability projects across Wales.
* Small grants will be distributed to nine Disabled People's Organisations (DPOs) to support vital work and respond to COVID-19 needs.
* A report on the impact of COVID on disabled people will be produced, led by Professor Debbie Foster from Cardiff University.
* The "Action on Disability" framework from 2019 will be refreshed to incorporate lessons learned during the pandemic.

The official also expresses gratitude to stakeholders and DPOs for their input through various forums, including the Disability Equality Forum, which has helped inform government efforts.
