The guidance provides best practices for managing records and information in Private Offices within UK government departments. The records management policies and procedures should align with those adopted by the department and include measures to ensure the integrity and availability of information. This guidance applies to a range of records, including correspondence, submissions, minutes, emails, notes, and diaries. The purpose of these procedures is to ensure that records are readily retrievable, reduce risks associated with litigation, promote accountability, allow for historical and research purposes, and protect valuable information.

The specific categories of records covered by this guidance include:

* Letters and minutes from outside the department
* Submissions from policy areas
* Annotated submissions and Ministerial views/decisions conveyed via email or notes
* Records requiring a response or decision within a Minister's area of responsibility
* Outgoing correspondence relating to official business
* Documents received and dealt with exclusively by Private Office
* Cabinet documents (subject to separate guidance)
* Ministers' official diaries and records of meetings with outside interest groups/lobbyists
* Records of discussions using instant messaging
* Private Secretaries' notebooks
* Ministers' notebooks

The guidance notes that records related to a Minister's personal interests or constituency work should be kept separately and managed in accordance with the Minister's wishes.


The text outlines guidelines for recording events and decisions made by Ministers and officials in a government department. It highlights the importance of creating records of all meetings, events, and communications that involve decisions or follow-up actions on departmental or government policy.

Records should be kept up to date and cover:

* Ministerial diaries
* Meetings with other Ministers, officials, dignitaries, lobby groups, MPs, and private sector organizations
* Responses to policy areas and views expressed by the Minister
* Telephone conversations, instant messaging, and text discussions of an official nature

On the other hand, records should not be created for:

* Purely informal or social meetings (e.g. regular management meetings)
* Briefing sessions or meetings that do not constitute formal discussions on matters of departmental or government policy
* Party political meetings and/or telephone conversations
* Meetings and/or telephone conversations to commission work that is actioned immediately
* Goodwill visits/hospitality where no policy decisions arise
* Presentations/seminars where no policy decisions arise

The text also mentions special categories of records, including:

* Ministers' official diaries (which must be preserved by the relevant Private Office and passed to the DRO for safekeeping)
* Records of formal meetings with outside interest groups/lobbyists (basic facts about the meeting should be recorded)

Overall, the guidelines aim to ensure that records are kept accurately and consistently across the government department, allowing for transparency and accountability.


The summary is:

The text outlines best practices for managing records in private offices in government departments. It emphasizes the importance of preserving public records, such as:

* Private secretaries' notebooks: destroy after six months, unless relevant details are transferred to official records.
* Ministers' notebooks: retain and transfer to the Departmental Record Office (DRO) at the end of their tenure.
* Sensitive papers: agree with DRO on a retention period for these files.
* Registered files: keep or pass to DRO depending on the contents and agreed-upon retention period.
* Declined invitations: keep for a set period, then destroy.

The text also highlights the importance of transparency and accountability in government record-keeping. It recommends that private offices follow one of two best practice models:

1. Private office records kept to support Ministers and policy areas;
2. A combination of electronic and paper elements retained in an Electronic Records Management (ERM) system or on a digital network.

The goal is to ensure the public records are preserved and can be accessed to demonstrate accountability, while also considering the needs of each department's private offices.


Here's a summary of the text:

The text discusses two models for managing Ministry records: Model 1 and Model 2. Model 1 recommends that Private Offices retain their own records, in addition to policy areas retaining complete records. This approach aims to ensure risk management and clear responsibility for decision-making processes. Private Offices must capture and store records properly, and convey any comments or annotations to policy areas. Policy areas are responsible for bringing together the whole record in the departmental electronic filing system.

Model 2 relies on policy areas to retain full and accurate records, with the Private Office not needing to be concerned about capturing records into the departmental records system. Instead, policy areas are responsible for storing and integrating both electronic and paper elements of a record in the corporate filing system.

The key points are:

* Risk management is important, and clear responsibility for decision-making processes must be established.
* Private Offices should capture and store their own records, as well as convey comments/annotations to policy areas.
* Policy areas are responsible for integrating both electronic and paper elements of a record into the departmental filing system.
* Records not captured in the departmental records system should be passed to the DRO at an agreed time (or on a change of Administration).
* No records can be weeded or disposed of by Private Offices, as this is the responsibility of the DRO.


The text appears to be guidance notes for private offices within a government department on managing and disposing of records. The main points are:

* Private Offices need to have confidence that record management procedures in other policy areas meet certain standards.
* Records should be retained for a reasonable period, then disposed of according to the scheduled below:
	+ Minister's Notebooks: pass to DRO at end of tenure
	+ Private Secretaries' Notebooks: destroy after 6 months
	+ Engagement Diaries: pass to DRO annually and at end of tenure
	+ Files of correspondence: close ERM folders, pass to DRO for permanent preservation or published web content
	+ Outgoing material (invitations): retention period to be agreed with the DRO

Additionally, the guidance notes that records should be captured regularly from all portable media and passed to the record office at end of tenure.


The text outlines guidelines for record-keeping and information management within a government department's private office. The key points are:

1. Regularly capture and pass electronic versions of content to the Departmental Records Officer (DRO) on shared drives, personal drives, email, USB sticks, and palm-tops.
2. Retain published web content, including non-departmental sites like Flickr and YouTube, for 6 months before destruction.
3. Keep registered files for Ministerial briefing papers, Permanent Secretary's materials, and Chief Executive's content.
4. Capture policy minutes of meetings after 1 year and pass to the DRO.
5. Record formal meetings with outside interest groups/lobbyists and pass to the DRO.
6. Retain non-fixed information exchange methods like telephone calls, live web feeds, and email exchanges (including attachments) for a retention period agreed with the DRO.
7. Keep a record of discussions, including significant phone calls, on a registered file.

Overall, the guidelines emphasize the importance of storing records in the departmental records system and periodically transferring electronic versions to the DRO for permanent preservation.


The text provides guidelines for managing records in a Private Office, which handles correspondence, submissions, and other materials related to a Minister's policy areas. The guidelines emphasize the importance of maintaining accurate and complete records to ensure accountability. The highlights are:

* Records should be stored in the departmental records system and copies retained for administrative convenience should be sent or destroyed after an agreed period.
* Records kept outside of the system should be sent to the Departmental Records Officer (DRO) at an agreed time.
* Materials coming into the Private Office, such as correspondence, submissions, documents, and discussions from web forums, should be stored in the department's records system.
* Materials being sent out from the Private Office, including annotated submissions, responses or decisions, and Cabinet meeting notes, should also be stored in the department's records system.

Overall, the guidelines aim to promote good record-keeping practices to ensure that the policy story can be accurately reconstructed and accountability demonstrated.
