Title: INQ000350057 - Paper from Welsh Government Technical Advisory Group titled statement regarding NPIs in the pre-christmas period, dated 02/12/2020.

 This text presents a statement from the Technical Advisory Group regarding non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) in Wales during the pre-Christmas period in 2020. The main messages include the effectiveness of social distancing and quarantine measures to prevent infection spread, as well as the importance of minimizing household mixing and adhering to recommended restrictions. Survey data suggests a misconception regarding the risks of transmission associated with mixing households or individuals indoors. 

Policy modeling demonstrates that lowering the Rt (reproduction rate) through social distancing reduces deaths and pressure on the National Health Service (NHS). Implementing Tier 3-level restrictions before any planned relaxation would decrease hospitalization rates and COVID-19 related deaths. Daily surveillance reports show a national picture of around 226 cases per 100,000 people with a 13.3% positivity rate, with higher numbers for those over 60 years old. Some local areas experienced rising case numbers similar to levels prior to the firebreak implemented earlier. The firebreak managed to slow down transmission rates temporarily, but these benefits nearly disappeared as infection numbers increased again.


 The text discusses the COVID-19 situation in various local authorities and health boards within Wales. There are 4 areas (Aneurin Bevan, Cwm Taf Morgannwg, Swansea Bay) with very high case numbers (over 200 cases per 100K), while Hywel Da, Powys, and Betsi Cadwaladr have higher rates as well (over 50 cases per 100K). Some smaller and more rural areas are lower. Overall, Wales is considered very high risk. There's an increase in over-60s cases reported across all health boards, potentially due to care home outbreaks or intergenerational mixing.

The national Rt (effective reproduction rate) from the Official SAGE estimate suggests that hospital admissions and deaths might rise over the next 2-3 weeks depending on the age structure of cases. Death rates are currently similar to May levels, with Wales having a higher excess death rate than England and Scotland.

The text also covers various interventions and measures taken in response to the pandemic. These include local health protection zones and the Firebreak in Wales. It highlights that while non-pharmaceutical interventions have an impact on epidemic growth, they also come with socioeconomic harms.

In light of Christmas celebrations, there may be increased transmission due to intergenerational mixing and extended household mixing. Rising infection rates among older adults will likely result in higher hospitalization and mortality post-Christmas. New technologies for rapid testing can aid in reducing test results' lag time but might not match the sensitivity of primary frontline tests like RT-PCR. 

Finally, non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) aim to reduce transmission by limiting mixing between infectious and susceptible individuals. With higher community infection rates before Christmas, a larger number of people may need to self-isolate or quarantine during the festive season.


 The text discusses strategies for minimizing COVID-19 transmission during the Christmas period. It suggests that people might need to self-isolate or quarantine more over the holidays. Pre-isolating (avoiding contact outside one's household) for a full incubation period of 10 days can significantly reduce infection risks.

During this period, if someone develops symptoms, they should not meet others and should immediately seek an RT-PCR swab test. If people postpone seeing others over Christmas and avoid in-person meetings until later or opt for remote interactions, it is strongly advised. Pre-isolation could also be helpful when visiting older relatives, particularly for families with children.

People with jobs that come with a higher risk of infection (e.g., warehouse/factory workers, health/social care workers) should consider pre-isolation before meeting older adults to reduce transmission risks. It's best not to expose older family members to potential infections, no matter the reason for contact.

Until widespread vaccination is achieved, giving people practical advice on visiting loved ones safely, such as shorter stays, good hand hygiene, and ventilation, will be crucial. Most transmission occurs due to prolonged, close interactions with familiar people within a home environment. Pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic transmissions can also occur.

SAGE papers highlight how to handle Christmas and festivals during the pandemic. SAGE Environmental Modelling Group found that transmission risks are a combination of environmental and behavioral factors. High-risk contacts involve close, prolonged interactions in indoor spaces, face-to-face, poorly ventilated areas, or crowded places. These conditions are often present within hospitality settings. Alcohol consumption can increase difficulties with social distancing due to disinhibitory effects on judgement and inhibitions. Several outbreak clusters were associated with bars and households in April 2020, while fewer were linked to schools.


The text discusses findings from health organizations like the US CDC and Public Health England regarding COVID-19 infections. The US CDC found that individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 without known close contact to a confirmed case were more likely to have dined at restaurants (2.8 times) or visited bars/coffee shops (3.9 times). Public Health England's findings showed increased odds for COVID-19 among people working in warehouses, construction, hospitality, and healthcare settings. Engaging in entertainment activities was also linked to higher infection risks. 

Contact tracing data shows that commercial workplaces were associated with clusters of infections, particularly pubs and clubs, which accounted for 23% of these clusters in Wales between September 21st and October 20th. The hospitality industry consistently had the highest number of improvement notices and closure notices due to non-compliance with restrictions. Despite COVID secure environments implemented by the industry, it remains challenging to separate infection risks from related activities such as commuting or visiting multiple venues.

Cases and contacts in schools are increasing, but there's no clear evidence that school reopenings directly caused an increase in infections. Instead, factors like the opening of workplaces, parents returning to work, social mixing in shops and hospitality, and community-wide social interactions could play a role.


 The text discusses various non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) during the pandemic and their impacts on different aspects of society. Schools have been affected significantly as one of the most often closed NPIs during high transmission levels. However, closing schools should be a last resort due to its negative effects on children's health, wellbeing, and learning. Movement data in Wales suggests that schools being open can lead to increased mobility.

Forming extended Christmas bubbles could increase infection risks within multigenerational households. While partial school closures were implemented during autumn firebreak, SAGE (Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies) took into account earlier advice regarding the modelled impacts. With rising COVID-19 infections among 12-16 year olds, children played a more significant role in introducing infection to households.

To mitigate harm from school closures, options such as remote learning, opening hub schools for essential workers and vulnerable children or shortening holiday periods have been considered. However, these measures may increase inequality, as online learning might not be accessible to lower socioeconomic groups.

Considering the significant harms caused by school closures, it's crucial to weigh the risks and benefits carefully before making any decisions on further school closures post-Christmas. Further evidence will help determine the best course of action to minimize negative consequences while protecting public health. If schools transition to a blended format during term-end weeks, attention should be given to displacement activities that could lead to increased social interactions. The focus for such week(s) should be on isolation and reducing social contacts with a clear 'stay at home' message for all age groups. Additionally, efforts for shared responsibility and long-term behavior change in adhering to safety guidelines continue to be pursued.


 The text highlights how minor breaches in COVID-19 guidelines, when considered at a population level, can have a significant impact. Most people in Wales are adhering to the guidelines with exceptions usually linked to barriers such as guideline understanding, lack of skills (like saying no), and limited access to support (financial, practical, and emotional). Confidence in the Welsh Government remains high but some people disagree with restrictions and might not comply. Survey data indicates some level of indoor mixing outside extended households along with misunderstandings about transmission risks. Mobility increased post-firebreak, and pre-Christmas mixing in hospitality and retail is anticipated.
 
While a vaccine brings hope, people's behaviors may change after the firebreak or following relaxation of restrictions. Effective public communication on risk, consistent across the UK, with clear reasoning remains crucial. Financial support and encouragement for social, emotional, and practical support should be maintained. This includes tailored communication strategies that factor in demographics and cultural differences, as well as the importance of engaging, explaining, encouraging before enforcing measures.


The text discusses factors that contribute to an increase in undesirable behaviors during festive seasons, and emphasizes the need for strategies to minimize transmission risks. Early intervention has been seen as more effective than late actions, while shorter, intense interventions also yield better results. However, adherence wanes over time. Firebreaks and stricter restrictions can help lower community transmission levels. Rules must be simple, understandable, achievable, with a defined beginning and end.

SAGE (Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies) agrees that entering the Christmas period with low community transmission is preferable to high rates. High prevalence in communities often leads to outbreaks in hospitals, care homes, prisons, and residential settings. A new Reasonable Worst Case scenario has been produced by Swansea University, which models the potential impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions in pre and post-Christmas periods.

The policy scenarios analyzed transmission levels similar to Scottish Level 2 or 3, or England Tier 2 or 3 restrictions prior to Christmas. These were based on an Rt value (effective reproduction number) from 16 October of approximately 1.3 with a 10% higher value for increased seasonal transmission during winter. Modeling revealed potential benefits in terms of reduced deaths, NHS occupancy, and ICU bed usage under Tier 2 and 3 scenarios. The analysis also shows that lower Rc (reproduction number controlling for interventions) would significantly impact mortality rates. Six different pre-Christmas policy scenarios are modeled to show their potential effects during the festive season.


The text presents a modeling analysis of potential COVID-19 hospitalizations, ICU beds requirement, and mortality rates during the Christmas period with varying levels of social mixing ("ne" indication). The "background Rt", representing the basic reproduction rate, is initially assumed to be 1.3 (as of December 2, 2020) in the first no intervention scenario, resulting in a cumulative total of 8,570 hospital cases, 1,030 ICU beds required, and 2,520 deaths.

The text further explores the implications if the "background Rt" increases to 1.4 - this results in a higher demand for both hospital and ICU beds, as well as a corresponding increase in mortality rates. The analysis also outlines the impact of varying interventions ("Tier 2", "Tier 3") with reduced social contact scaling on these metrics during pre-Christmas periods.

Accompanying figures display graphical representations of deaths per day, ICU occupancy, and hospital bed occupancies between October 2020 and March 2021 for different pre-Christmas scenarios based on varying levels of social mixing, contact scaling ("Tier 2", "Tier 3"), and background reproduction rates.
