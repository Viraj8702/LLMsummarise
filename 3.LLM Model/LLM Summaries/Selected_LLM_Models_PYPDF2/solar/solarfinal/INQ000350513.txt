Title: INQ000350513 - Email chain between Chris Whitty (Chief Medical Officer for England, UK Government), Frank Atherton (Chief Medical Officer, Welsh Government), Rob Orford (Chief Scientific Adviser for Health, Welsh Government) and colleagues, regarding an overview of UK Strategy, dated 22/03/2020.

The text presents a discussion about strategies to handle a current outbreak situation in the UK, expressing disagreement with the current SAGE twin peak model focused on Imperial (1). The author suggests an alternative approach of immediate maximum short-term suppression coupled with aggressive but refined testing, isolation, and release. This method involves household containment by eliminating societal mixing through closure of non-essential businesses and limited movements for essential purposes. A defined end-point is proposed, such as when hospital admissions in Wales decrease to under 5 per day, and the implementation of a community testing and control strategy. The author acknowledges the challenges associated with this approach but considers it better than the alternative scenarios, highlighting that a similar response might be necessary due to mutation rates in the future. The text concludes by sharing this proposed draft within the government while awaiting official clearance.
