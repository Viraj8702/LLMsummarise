Title: INQ000350094 - Emails between Lee Waters (Deputy Minister for Economy and Transport) and (Private Secretary Deputy Minister Economy and Transport, Welsh Government) regarding a review of post-firebreak restrictions, between 19/11/2020 and 15/12/2020.

 The text is a communication between individuals discussing various topics related to restrictions in Wales during COVID-19. It covers closed facilities under Tier 4, such as gyms and swimming pools, while supermarkets remain open with potential restrictions on the sale of non-essential items. There's a request for updates on decisions regarding gyms in Tier 4 and what restrictions may apply to supermarkets at different levels. Additionally, matters concerning penalties for unlicensed music events and business failures are brought up. The private secretary, Lee Waters AS/MS, serves as the Deputy Minister for Economy and Transport in Wales and is comfortable communicating in both English and Welsh.


The text provides an overview of various regulatory changes and penalties that came into effect following discussions between authorities. These alterations include reducing fines for failure to self-isolate upon international travel, increasing penalties for organizing large events, lowering fines for international travel operators who fail to provide required information to travelers, and examining the creation of additional offenses for "reckless" self-isolation breaches. The parties involved agreed to a systematic review to ensure clarity about enforcing authorities' roles regarding each offense and to discuss with all authorities to maintain an appropriate law enforcement response in relation to seriousness.


 The text outlines discussions regarding retaining current restrictions and Fixed Penalty Notices (FPNs) as advised in a specific MA. The First Minister concurred with all proposals relating to business penalties during the review, but some suggestions require further clarification or discussion before approval. These include aligning penalty values for failure to self-isolate after international travel and organizing events above certain capacities with Scottish levels, as suggested by the Consultation Group (CG). The First Minister finds it necessary to obtain the CG's view on these proposals. Another issue arises concerning an FPN for unlicensed music events, with a call for more information following Deputy Minister Alun Michael's disapproval of removing this penalty. Additionally, the text mentions that further discussion is required after learning about England's decision to not impose additional penalties of similar nature until court-level penalties are addressed.


 The text discusses concerns in England related to court-level penalties for issues that have not yet been addressed. It brings up the question of how this would affect local police opinions. Additionally, there are three proposals with less contention; however, it is preferred that ministerial colleagues provide comments before proceeding. Regarding a private office request, they ask for confirmation on ministers' review of Fixed Penalty Notices (FPNs) mentioned in document 5, and they need feedback as soon as possible. The First Minister aims to make a final decision on this matter on Monday. There is also a mention of an attachment with advice related to the first post-firebreak restriction review for the First Minister. A translation of the Welsh draft Written Statement will be provided the following day.
