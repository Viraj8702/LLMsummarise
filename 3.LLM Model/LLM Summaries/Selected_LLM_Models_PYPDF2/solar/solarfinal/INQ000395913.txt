Title: INQ000395913 - Email chain between Dr Rob Orford (Chief Scientific Adviser for Health, Welsh Government), Reg Kilpatrick (Director General, Covid Crisis Coordination, Welsh Government) and colleagues, regarding Covid fire break, dated between 15/10/2020 and 18/10/2020.

In the provided text, Reg Kilpatrick from Welsh Government/Llywodraeth Cymru discusses various aspects of their COVID-19 response strategy with other officials including Huw Morris. Key issues include a need for better testing strategies, ensuring compliance with isolation requirements, and providing financial incentives for people to isolate. Reg suggests that alternative approaches, such as those implemented by some universities, could be helpful. They also emphasize the importance of tracking infection rates (RWC) and developing more accessible point-of-care tests. The effectiveness of a firebreak measure is debated, with concerns raised regarding wasted economic activity if proper measures are not put in place. Huw Morris shares additional comments on the economic impact to Tom and Andrew, addressing questions from businesses about closing down despite adapting to become COVID secure.


The text presents a discussion among multiple parties who question the reasoning behind certain decisions and demand evidence. Jonathan highlights the need for clarity on why specific choices are made, considering the potential backlash due to arguments like preventing outdoor congregation near shops while allowing open-air gyms. Emma Watkins, Deputy Director of Economic Policy, is involved in this exchange.

Tom raises concerns over the apparent low impact on R (the reproduction number) from closing non-essential retail amidst high economic costs and its disproportionate effect on lower-paid employees. He emphasizes that major benefits associated with a firebreak, such as avoided deaths, are based on a case with only a 10% probability. Consequently, he suggests considering an option without closing non-essential retail while ensuring benefits' comparability and including the potential negative social and economic consequences.

Andrew, while praising Tom for his efforts, argues that underestimating negative impacts of firebreak measures should be avoided. These negative repercussions mainly concern the economy and individuals whose incomes are reduced and long-term life chances adversely affected. The depths of the global recession are highlighted, with shutting down large parts of the economy exacerbating this situation. Some analysts suggest a firebreak could lower GDP by an additional 5%, some portion of which might not be recovered permanently.

Ultimately, Andrew acknowledges that provided evidence doesn't offer alternative options for Ministers regarding strict firebreak measures, yet it is crucial to recognize the significant negative impacts and their role in saving lives during this period. The text concludes with a message from Andrew regarding draft papers intended for Cabinet consideration and legal support.


The text provides a series of communications among several parties regarding the preparation and circulation of legal papers related to COVID-19 support measures for the Cabinet's consideration. The FM wants to see these papers around 11 am, with suggested changes focused on errors and mistakes rather than extensive discussions or lengthy comments. Annex B and C were already discussed, so further revisions aren't preferred. Feedback in digestible formats are requested by 10:30 AM for incorporation into the papers before sending them to Cabinet members around midday. The last section recaps a discussion during a Cabinet meeting where the principle of a firebreak proposal was agreed upon, subject to certain conditions and details being worked out at an accelerated pace. These conditions involve securing business support arrangements, providing clarity on post-firebreak regulations, and defining the actions that would be undertaken in the two weeks of firebreak.


The text outlines various areas of discussion that emerged, requiring further work and advice in response to a firebreak measure. These include assumptions about informal childcare, public services continuation, community centers and places of worship regulations, and a list of reasonable excuses for movement during the firebreak period. Specific concerns involve secondary schools' options and preferred approaches, with teachers working but uncertainties on pupil attendance and exam management.

Outdoor activities are another area of concern; it is debatable whether to restrict gatherings outdoors, allow organised events, and maintain playgrounds open during specific occasions like Halloween, Guy Fawkes Night, and Remembrance Sunday. Local governments' discussions are required on amenity approaches and by-appointment only arrangements. A decision about transport capacity also remains pending.

New issues arose due to the "stay at home" directive which means considering sectors closure or continued operation as seen in the first lockdown, such as manufacturing, construction, offices, hotels (for key workers and essential staff). People working in England would have reasonable excuses for traveling if required by their employers. The summary is presented from an email sent by Thomas Smithson, COVID-19 Project Team, Llywodraeth Cymru / Welsh Government.
