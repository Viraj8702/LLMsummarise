Title: INQ000396684 - Guidance from the Cabinet Office / The National Archives titled Guidance on Private Office Records, dated 17/06/2009.

 The text presents guidelines for managing records in Ministers' offices and Permanent Secretaries' departments. Originally issued in April 2001 and revised in June 2004, this version further clarifies certain aspects and includes governance requirements. The guidance applies to all types of information created by any medium including modern technologies like instant messaging and texts. It emphasizes creating records for meetings/events where decisions on departmental or government policies are made.

While primarily intended for Ministers' and Permanent Secretaries' offices, this guideline can be applicable to other senior public servants as well. The management of Special Advisers' records requires separate consideration. All political and parliamentary business papers should be kept separately by the Special Adviser. 

This guidance is pertinent to records created by or passed through private offices which relate to the department's business activities, defined as "public records" under the Public Records Act 1958 (PRA). Furthermore, departments must adhere to other relevant legislations such as the Freedom of Information Act 2000 (FOIA), Data Protection Act 1998 (DPA), Environmental Information Regulations 2004 (EIRs) and the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988. This guidance will continue to evolve with advancing departmental electronic systems.


 The text outlines guidelines for information management and records policies followed by private offices under various regulations, including the Environmental Information Regulations 2004 (EIRs), Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988. The Code of Practice under Section 46 of the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) provides guidance for public authorities regarding discharging their functions under FOIA. Private offices should adhere to their department's records management policies that include specific procedures for private offices, and these policies may be adapted to match the departmental style.

Information within private office records can be subject to access requests as per FOIA, Data Protection Act (DPA), and EIRs. Implementing good records and information management practices ensures: easy retrievability of records, reduced risks in litigation, accountability, an audit trail that conveys ministerial views to the relevant policy areas, identification for historical and research purposes, and protection of valuable resources.

The guidance covers various types of records: communications from outside the department, including those from ministers, officials from other departments, and members of the public; submissions from policy areas; annotated Minister's documents; emails/notes with ministerial views/decisions; official response-requiring documents; outgoing correspondence copies; documents exclusively handled by private offices; cabinet documents (subject to separate guidance); Minister's diaries and meetings records with outside groups/lobbyists; records of instant messaging discussions; and private secretaries' and ministers' notebooks. Constituency, party political, and personal interest-related records handled by ministerial private offices fall outside this guidance and should be managed according to the minister's wishes.


 The text outlines guidelines for creating records of events involving ministers and officials. These should be maintained for meetings where decisions are made on departmental or government policies, follow-up actions are required, or valuable viewpoints are expressed by individuals not present. Types of events requiring recordkeeping include ministerial diaries, policy responses, meetings between ministers and other parties (e.g., other ministers, officials, dignitaries), and conversations related to official business.

Certain informal or social occasions don't require documentation, such as regular management meetings among a minister's private office team, briefing sessions for Parliamentary events, confidential discussions between ministers/officials, party political meetings, commissioning tasks immediately actioned, and goodwill visits with no policy decisions.

Special categories of records include official ministerial diaries that are considered public records, needing to be preserved by their private offices and transferred to the Departmental Record Officer (DRO) annually. Also mentioned is the recording of basic facts about formal meetings between ministers and external interest groups/lobbyists, in accordance with the government's response to a Committee on Standards in Public Life recommendation.


This text discusses recommendations from the Committee on Standards in Public Life's Sixth Report for managing records in private offices. It outlines guidelines for retaining, transferring, and eventually destroying various types of documents, such as recommendations 27 and 28 records, sensitive papers, registered files (both electronic and paper format), declined invitations, private secretaries' notebooks, ministers' notebooks, and copies of outgoing correspondence. The best practice is to follow one of four suggested models for record management or adapt them according to the needs of each private office. This ensures accountability by maintaining a clear policy story as records are transferred and eventually destroyed at agreed times with the departmental Records Officer (DRO).


This text discusses two models for record management in government offices - Model 1 emphasizes shared responsibility between Private Offices and policy areas to ensure accountability and clear risk management. Under this model, both entities maintain their own records and communicate any necessary changes or annotations between each other. The Private Office is responsible for documenting actions derived from submissions but not disposing of records; that function falls under the Departmental Records Officer (DRO). Model 2 relies solely on policy areas to store all records, electronic or physical, in a centralized departmental system and maintain full responsibility for this process. In this model, the Private Office delegates record-keeping to the responsible policy area, focusing instead on managing submissions and actions derived from them.


 The text describes a records management model for Private Offices within departments, emphasizing the need for confidence in record procedures of related policy areas. This is important because cross-department work could potentially impact major reputational risks. Under this framework, Private Offices must ensure that their record management standards are consistent with those in other relevant policy areas.

Guidance on this model suggests obtaining advice from TNA (The National Archives), with the understanding that guidelines will be updated regularly. Related guidance is available in various sources including the Ministerial Code, General Election Guidance, and Directory of Civil Service Guidance. Furthermore, a code for Special Advisers exists as well.

An example records management disposal schedule is also presented which includes provisions for managing items such as minister's notebooks, private secretaries' notebooks, engagement diaries, correspondence files, outgoing materials, and emails throughout a minister's term of office. The aim here is to ensure that records are archived appropriately or destroyed according to an agreed schedule.


 The text provides guidelines for managing various types of events, media, meetings, communications, and correspondence within a government context. It highlights that electronic versions should be stored in the departmental ERM (Electronic Records Management) system, shared drives, personal drives, emails, USB sticks, and palm-tops. The records include: web content (6-12 months before destruction), briefings for ministers and their electronic records, wikis, blogs, video updates, internal communications, official/unofficial government sites, published policy meeting minutes (passed to DRO for preservation after 1 year), formal meetings with interest groups, telephone conversations regarding official business, emails and attachments, film/audio files. Transcripts of ministerial and Chief Executive content should all be passed to the Departmental Records Officer (DRO) for permanent preservation. Paper correspondence must also be maintained where it still exists. The text mentions that retention periods will need agreement with the DRO.


The text outlines guidelines for managing various types of communications, records, and interactions in a private office setting. It emphasizes maintaining good record-keeping practices to reconstruct policy developments and demonstrate accountability. The mentioned communication channels include handled meetings, teleconversations, instant messaging, oral briefings, and minister's official diaries. Records from outside the department, cabinet instructions, web forums, and correspondence should all be managed following specified protocols. Model 2 requires policy areas to ensure records are stored within the departmental records system, with agreements on transferring external records or destroying them after a predetermined time. These "handy hints" supplement rather than replace other guidance related to private office administration.
