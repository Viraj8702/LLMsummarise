Title: INQ000400585 - Witness statement provided by Dr Christopher Williams on behalf of Public Health Wales,  dated 19/01/2024.

The text is a witness statement from Dr. Chris Williams, a Consultant Epidemiologist at Public Health Wales. In response to a request by an inquiry team, he provides information on hospital admissions and inpatient data covering February 2020 - June 2022 for individuals with positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests in Wales. A COVID-19 case is defined as someone with a positive test in the specified time frame. Hospital admission can be related or unrelated to the SARS-CoV-2 positive status. Data from public health and hospital patient administrative systems was linked using patient NHS numbers. Over approximately 16 months, there were almost 24,000 COVID-19 case admissions in Welsh hospitals with Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board having the highest number of admissions at 21%.


 The text presents statistical data on COVID-19 cases admitted to hospitals and intensive care units (ICU) in Wales from March 2020 to June 2022. There were multiple peaks in case admissions, notably at the end of March 2020, late December 2020/early January 2021, and several smaller spikes during Autumn 2021 onwards.

Variation in hospital admissions is influenced by factors such as changing COVID-19 incidence rates, testing availability, severity of different virus variants, the vaccination campaign's progress, and community disease management improvements. Some health boards had a higher number of admitted cases due to population size and incidence rate within their catchment areas, as well as hospital bed capacity.

The text also highlights that ICU admissions peaked with those of general hospital admissions for COVID-19. Notably, there was a notch in the case admission chart during autumn 2020 due to the "fire-break" intervention from October 23 to November 9, 2020.


 The text provides an analysis of changes in COVID-19 peak admissions to intensive care units and hospitals across various Health Boards over multiple waves. Heightened peaks have been observed to decrease with each successive wave, suggesting improved patient treatment, management, and the impact of widespread vaccine rollout. Patient outcomes have consequently improved, leading to reduced demand for intensive care support. In general, health boards experienced peaks concurrently; however, Hywel Dda UHB consistently had lower case admissions in all waves. There were larger distinctions among Health Boards' case admissions during the second wave as compared to subsequent waves. Weekly intensive care admissions, particularly post first two waves, are challenging to interpret due to smaller numbers.


 The text presents statistical data on COVID-19 cases admitted to hospitals and intensive care units in certain health boards from September 2021 to June 2022. The organnwg UHB consistently had higher numbers of admissions compared to other health boards, followed by Betsi Cadwaladr UHB with a peak in January. Out of the 20-year age categories, those aged between 60-79 years had the highest number of hospital admissions (35% of all cases admitted), with the fewest admissions being in the 0-19 age group at 6%.

The highest number of intensive care admissions also fell within the 60-79 year age group, making up 45% of total cases. The highest proportion of intensive care admissions relative to their overall case count was observed in the 40-59 age group (17%). Only 3% of intensive care admissions were within the 80+ age group.

The age distribution of hospital and intensive care admissions is influenced by factors including underlying population demographics, severity of disease, comorbidities, and benefits from intensive care support. Older age groups may have fewer intensive care admissions not due to a less severe disease but their reduced ability to benefit from intensive care support.

Over time, cases admitted to hospital peaked within the 60-79 year age group; this trend decreased in older age groups after wave two while younger age groups saw an overall increase with each subsequent wave likely due to changes in immunity and virus epidemiology. The pattern in intensive care admissions also showed highest cases among 60-79 year age group across different waves.



The text provides a summary of statistics on COVID-19 cases admitted to hospitals and intensive care units between March 2020 and June 2022. In each wave, the highest number of case admissions to ICUs were observed in the age groups of 40-59 and 60-75 years old. These groups saw a significant reduction in ICU cases post second wave. A higher percentage (51%) of total hospitalized cases were female compared to male; however, a majority (63%) of intensive care admissions were males. Over the first two waves, more male cases were admitted to hospitals than females but from early 2022 onwards, more women were admitted. The data also suggests that in general, there were consistently more male patients admitted to hospital than female during the initial stages, while by the end of the period observed (June 2022), this trend reversed with more female admissions.


The text presents a statistical analysis of COVID-19 cases admitted to hospitals and intensive care units (ICU) in Wales between March 2020 and June 2022. There have consistently been more male than female cases admitted to ICUs, with higher differences during the initial waves. Over time, there's been a greater reduction of male cases compared to females.

The Welsh Index of Multiple Deprivation (WIMD) identifies areas with high levels of deprivation and is used to analyze case admissions by deprivation quintile. Seventy-nine percent of all hospital admission cases and 78% of ICU cases were assigned to a WIMD quintile. It was observed that the number of cases admitted to hospitals and ICUs increased as deprivation levels increased, with 26% and 27% residing in the most deprived quintile, respectively.

A similar percentage of cases from each deprivation quintile were admitted to ICU from hospital admissions; however, the highest percentage was observed in the most deprived quintile at 8.7%, while the least deprived quintile had a rate of 7.6%. The document outlines definitions for COVID-19 hospital and intensive care inpatients, stating that these counts represent 'point prevalence' surveys on Sundays.


The text presents data related to the number of hospitalized COVID-19 patients, including those in high dependency units. The data was sourced from Public Health Wales Datastore database and hospital patient administrative systems via ICNET. Linking patients and tests using NHS numbers provided accurate information from March 1, 2020. Weekly counts were used for continuous admissions data.

Overall, COVID-19 hospital inpatient trends aligned closely with case admission patterns. The peak of around 2,000 inpatients occurred during Winter 2020/21, and the following peaks in inpatients from Autumn 2021 were larger due to increased incidence caused by Omicron. This also reflected heightened screening measures in hospitals for detecting asymptomatic cases and the Omicron variant's higher transmissibility within hospital settings.

Similarly, trends in intensive care COVID-19 patients mirrored general COVID-19 patient patterns. The highest single-day count of around 100 intensive care inpatient cases was in April 2020 and January 2021. There was a substantial decrease in the number of such cases between Wave 2 and subsequent waves, with numbers generally declining since November 2021.


 The text provides an analysis of COVID-19 patients in extensive care between Wave 2 and later waves, noting that numbers generally decreased since November 2021. Figures 11 and 12 illustrate this decline for overall COVID-19 hospital inpatients and intensive care inpatients, respectively, according to Health Boards and week endings from March 8, 2020, to June 26, 2022. In the first wave, maximum numbers of COVID-19 inpatients were found in Aneurin Bevan, Cardiff and Vale, and Swansea Bay UHBs, followed by similar peaks during Winter 2020/21 in Cwm Taf Morgannwg, Cardiff and Vale, and Betsi Cadwaladr UHBs. The peak numbers of intensive care inpatients were also significant in Aneurin Bevan, Cardiff and Vale, Swansea Bay UHBs during the first wave. Health board peaks differed somewhat across subsequent waves; however, COVID-19 inpatient numbers for larger health boards were relatively consistent, except for Betsi Cadwaladr UHB in January and April 2022 when significantly higher numbers of COVID-19 inpatients were observed.


The text provides statistical data on COVID-19 hospital inpatients by age and sex, collected between March 8, 2020 and June 26, 2022. The figures were displayed in Figures 13 and 14. For regular wards (Figure 13), cases admitted were consistently highest in the 60-79 age group while inpatient cases remained high among the oldest groups: 80+ and 60-79. In one week in January 2021, approximately 900 COVID-19 patients aged 80 years or older were in Welsh hospitals. Intensive care (Figure 14) had more cases from the age ranges of 60-79 and 40-59 while showing significantly fewer cases for the youngest and oldest age groups. For all waves, intensive care cases predominantly originated from 60-79 and 40-59 age groups, with minimal inpatient cases from the very young or old (Figure 15). This pattern could be attributed to the longer hospital stays of older patients and targeted screening within hospitals.


 The text discusses COVID-19 hospitalizations and intensive care admissions over time in Wales, broken down by sex. Female COVID-19 patients have consistently outnumbered male patients since the first wave, although this difference is small. During the initial two waves, there were significantly more male patients compared to females. In later waves, numbers for both genders decreased, and the gap narrowed. Analysis of other protected characteristics (such as ethnicity) was not conducted due to incomplete data, but analysis by multiple deprivation indices is possible with additional effort. The text also provides population estimates by Health Board in Wales from 2021. Note that Powys Teaching Health Board doesn't have acute or general hospitals in the region and admissions of Welsh residents outside of Wales were not included.
