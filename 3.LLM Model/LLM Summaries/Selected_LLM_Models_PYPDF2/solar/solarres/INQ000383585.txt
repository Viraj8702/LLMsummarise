On January 31, 2020, a briefing call took place between UK Chief Medical Officers (CMOs) and Directors of Public Health. Chris from CMOs discussed the current COVID-19 epidemiology and explained two possible scenarios where the strategy could shift from containment to mitigation (though this was not yet the case). For planning purposes, they are currently using pandemic flu as a worst-case scenario. The CMO confirmed that they were considering treatment options and that the NERVTAG would provide advice on these.

During the question and answer session, concerns about university students, boarding schools, the Chinese community in the UK, and community cohesion were raised. It was agreed upon to improve communication strategies for specific recipient groups, including clearer information regarding quarantine measures and housing of repatriated individuals. The Deputy CMO (DCMO) committed to share relevant details with participants via email and address any concerns regarding changes to case definitions.
