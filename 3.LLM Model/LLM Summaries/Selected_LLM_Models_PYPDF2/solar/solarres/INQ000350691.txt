On December 1, 2020, Jane Hutt MS, the Deputy Minister and Chief Whip, issued a statement acknowledging the United Nations' International Day of Disabled People on December 3. This day is dedicated to promoting disabled people's rights and well-being and celebrating their achievements worldwide. The theme for 2020 focuses on creating a disability-inclusive, accessible, and sustainable post-COVID world.

The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted and amplified existing issues in society, particularly affecting the lives and mental well-being of disabled people due to isolation, disrupted routines, and diminished services. Data from ONS shows that in Wales between March and July, 68% or almost 7 out of every 10 COVID-related deaths came from disabled communities.

To improve this situation as we recover from the pandemic's impact, Wales must continue to progress beyond previous initiatives like the Disability Discrimination Act (1995). The Welsh Government adopts the Social Model of Disability that recognizes societal actions, influenced by ignorance, prejudice, and indifference, as disabling factors for people with impairments.

Jane Hutt expressed her support for a current consultation proposing a new fund to provide disabled people assistance in running for elected office during 2021 Senedd elections and the 2022 Local Government elections. This initiative aims to reduce barriers preventing individuals from participating in local democracy. Additionally, she emphasized that disabled people play an essential role in economic recovery, which led to the appointment of Disabled People Employment Champions in Wales.


The text discusses the efforts taken by Wales to promote and support employment opportunities for individuals with disabilities. This includes the appointment of Disabled People Employment Champions, who will aid employers across Wales in creating diverse workforces. A new toolkit called "A More Equal Wales: A Practical Guide for Employers employing Disabled People" is set to be launched on International Day of Disabled People.

Regular discussions with stakeholders and Disabled People's Organizations through a Disability Equality Forum have helped in understanding the pandemic's impact on different communities. The feedback provided by forum members has played an important role in shaping policies, such as modifying "Creating safer public places: Coronavirus" guidance to include accessibility considerations for urban centers and green spaces.

Wales acknowledges the adverse economic effects of the pandemic on third sector organizations and their ability to support members due to reduced income. In response, £200,000 from the Welsh Government's Reserves for Reconstruction package has been allocated to fund disability projects in Wales, augmenting a £100,000 allocation from a UK-wide COVID emergency scheme.

To gain insight into the impact of COVID-19 on disabled people, Professor Debbie Foster from Cardiff University will lead a project to produce a report. The Disability Equality Forum members will collaborate with her for gathering information, evidence, and case studies. This report is expected to inform a revision of the "Action on Disability" framework launched in 2019. Wales also invites all Senedd Members to celebrate International Day of Disabled People, recognizing the contribution made by disabled individuals in the country.
