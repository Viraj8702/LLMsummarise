 The Welsh Government issued an Information Management and Governance Policy in August 2018, last reviewed in February 2019. This policy outlines the management of Welsh Government information and records to ensure vital records are identified and retained according to operational needs and legal requirements. It defines roles and responsibilities for creation, safekeeping, assurance, usage, storage, sharing, publishing, and disposal of information.

The policy is located on their intranet and website, replacing the 2015 Information and Records Management Policy. The Permanent Secretary recognizes information management as a core function and provides necessary organizational support to ensure its effectiveness. The focus encompasses all formats of data, records, and information throughout their life cycle from creation or receipt to disposal.

To comply with the Public Records Act 1958 and other legislation, like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the Data Protection Act 2018, the Welsh Government needs to identify its information, age, reliability as evidence, and manage access and disposal for sensitive data. This policy is summarized by an eight-stage Information Lifecycle: Create, Assure, Use, Store, Access, Share, Publish, and Dispose, with principles emphasizing clear title formatting, retention application at creation, version control, metadata use, and protective markings following current Security policies.


 The text presents an overview of the Welsh Government's policy for assuring and managing information and its related systems. The policy focuses on risk assessment, balancing the need to protect confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information with efficient use. It ensures compliance with legislative requirements, assigns clear responsibilities for information assurance, protects personal data and privacy, maintains Information Asset Registers, performs Privacy Impact Assessments (PIAs) and Data Protection Impact Assessments, applies "privacy by design" in procurement processes, reports security incidents, and is guided by the SIRO Risk Appetite Statement. The policy also governs how the Welsh Government uses systems to manage information, considering privacy, sensitivity requirements, and statutory obligations throughout the creation and development process of these systems.


 This text outlines policies for managing and accessing data within the Welsh Government. It covers areas such as storing information on approved systems, using appropriate file plans and authorizations, preventing the long-term storage of data on removable media, migration of information with format changes, and maintaining a corporate Retention Schedule. The policy encourages keeping personal data minimal and accessible only to those with legitimate business needs, while also addressing security, privacy, and sensitivity requirements. Access controls are used for protecting sensitive information, and the taxonomy helps improve document retrieval through search engines. The sharing of information within the Welsh Government and with third parties is governed by this policy, aiming for reusability and adherence to legal requirements such as GDPR, Data Protection Act 2018, and Freedom of Information Act 2000.


 The text outlines a set of policies governing the management, protection, publishing, and disposal of intellectual property and information related to the Welsh Government. Key aspects include obtaining approvals from relevant IAO's, protecting intellectual property rights, adhering to freedom of information acts and data protection regulations, making information publicly available through a publication scheme, sharing personal data securely, and ensuring external publications follow appropriate quality checks and copyright laws. The policy also emphasizes considering disposal at the time of creation, retaining information as per business or regulatory needs, and applying retention and disposal schedules to shared corporate repositories. Additionally, the Welsh Government defines its systems for managing hardware, IT equipment, software, hardcopies, websites, social media, and "YouTube" content.


This text presents a series of guidelines for managing information and records in the context of the Welsh Government. The policies cover various aspects such as hardcopy documents, websites, messaging, Information Asset Registers, security classifications, naming conventions, file closures, email management, private offices' and the Office of the Permanent Secretary's records, EU-funded records, processing sensitive personal information, data sharing, transferring data outside the European Economic Area, collaborative work or outsourced records, open data, machinery of government changes, public inquiries, reviews, tribunals, litigation and legal matters, retention and disposal, selecting records for transfer to The National Archives (TNA), preserving information, managing copyrights for others' intellectual property, gaining access to Welsh Government public records, ensuring the reuse of publications, available training, monitoring and reporting on information and records management, and handling information when leaving the organization.


 The Welsh Government outlines its Information Management and Governance Policy, covering employees, contractors, consultants, suppliers, and partners. This policy is necessary due to legislative obligations such as the Public Records Act, Freedom of Information Act, Data Protection Act, and GDPR, which emphasize public access to information and personal/sensitive data processing.

The Civil Service Code enforces accurate official records and open information handling. Effective information and records management is essential for retrieving demanded information and ensuring legal processing of personal data. Key legislation includes the Public Records Act (1958 & 1967), Government of Wales Act (1998 & 2006), GDPR, Data Protection Act (2018), Law Enforcement Directive (LED) (2018), and Freedom of Information Act (2000).

The policy ensures that all parties understand their roles in creating and managing information efficiently, cost-effectively, and legally. This includes complying with the ISO standards for electronic records management. The overall aim is to enable evidence-based policymaking through access to historical records created by Welsh Government officials.


 This text outlines the management and governance policy surrounding Welsh Government's information and records under Crown Copyright terms. Reuse of government information adheres to the Re-use of Public Sector Information Regulations 2015. The policy scope includes all information created during Welsh Government's objectives delivery. As per ISO standard ISO 15489-1:2016, a record is defined as evidence or information produced by an organization or person for legal obligations or business transactions. This policy covers various formats and media, including digital files, paper records, emails, social media, audio/video recordings, etc.

The Lord Chancellor's Code of Practice on record management, under the Freedom of Information Act 2000, applies to all records regardless of media or information type. Welsh Government business areas need to ensure these systems adhere to this code and are listed in the Welsh Government's Information Asset Register. The records with long-term business value should be migrated to iShare for preservation.

The document also lists related policies such as Welsh Government Code of Practice on Access to Information, Security Policy, Information & Security Policy, Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA), and Equality Impact Assessments (EIA). Furthermore, it mentions approved corporate information management systems and software for storing records. Users receive provided IT equipment connected to the government network servers and internet access.


This text outlines the approved systems for storing corporate records and information at Welsh Government. The primary repository is iShare, an Electronic Document and Records Management System (EDRMS), used to store OFFICIAL, SECRET, and TOP SECRET information except under exceptional circumstances. For certain incompatible file types, such as linked spreadsheets or complex databases, team shared drives (R: and S:) are utilized with links back to iShare. 

Other specific systems include HR Self Service for human resources management, SAP Finance System for corporate financial management, PPIMS for WEFO's project and program information, CaSSI for Care Inspectorate Wales, and EDDMS for roads projects within Transport. Additionally, IRIS is used for an integrated Cafcass Cymru system. Shared drive usage allows storage of personal or temporary data not intended to be part of the corporate records. Staff have individual iShare Home folders for this purpose but should avoid saving corporate information there.


 The text provides an overview of various systems and methods used to store information within the organization. All staff have access to a personal iShare Home folder where corporate data must not be stored. Temporary storage is available in the iShare MyTemp files which deletes unused items after seven days. iShare Connect is a tool for sharing internal information with external stakeholders but should not be used as a primary corporate information storage. For emails, transitory messages must be deleted after action, while business-related ones should be saved to iShare records promptly.

The organization holds data in additional systems such as case management, grant management and geographical information systems. Data from these must be moved or referenced within iShare files whenever feasible. 

Hardcopy documents with SECRET and TOP SECRET classifications are considered official records. Scanning of hardcopies is the preferred method even when containing signatures; seeking legal guidance is advised for high-risk information. WG policy mandates that Travel & Subsistence (T&S) receipts be scanned or photographed and uploaded onto iShare. Electronic retention of records pertaining to Welsh Procurement Card transactions became mandatory from 1 April 2019.

Hardcopy reference files, as long as they adhere to security protocols, may exist in addition to the electronic records on iShare. However, complete hardcopy sets are not permitted as back-ups because it creates additional storage issues and increases the risk of breaching GDPR, the Data Protection Act 2018, and Section 46 of the Freedom of Information Act. Recent "yellow files" can remain for reference but should be sent to archiving once no longer needed for regular consultation.


 This text outlines the records management practices of the Welsh Government, particularly concerning digital platforms and communication channels. The retention and disposal schedules for public records on websites, social media (e.g., Facebook, Twitter), "You Tube" videos, texts/instant messages, and chat applications like MicroSoft Teams are explained. All these records are archived to ensure continued access to crucial government documents via persistent website links. As the web has become significant for conducting official business, the National Archives has created an Operational Selection Policy for website archiving.

Welsh Government websites are captured, preserved, and made accessible through UK Web and UK Government Web Archive. The social media strategy aims to set rules on work-related social media use within the Welsh Government and how it can be used to engage with the public and stakeholders. Text or instant messages, even when sent via private phones for official business, can create public records that users should manage and preserve appropriately. 

MicroSoft Teams, a replacement for previous communication tools, comes under the scope of Freedom of Information and Data Subject requests; its chat contents are retained for 30 days. The platform must not be used for making decisions concerning business, finance, or policies.


 This text outlines the management of information assets in Welsh Government directorates. A list of Information Asset Registers (IAR5) has been created to ensure proper protection and identify responsibility for groups of assets. Information Asset Owners (IAOs) are accountable for understanding asset holdings, changes, access, and movement.

When implementing new systems, it's crucial to consider recordkeeping requirements and legal obligations under GDPR/Data Protection Act, Freedom of Information Act, Public Records Act 1958, Statute of Limitations, and the Regulatory and Investigatory Powers Act. This includes aspects such as access and security, retention, disposal, digital continuity, archiving, audit requirements, and legal admissibility.

An information asset is a defined body of information managed as a single unit to be understood, shared, protected, and exploited effectively. Information assets have recognizable value, risk, content, and lifecycle. The Welsh Government adopted the HMG Security Classification Policy for all records created post-April 2014, while preserving historical classification systems for context and administrative history.

The text also discusses naming conventions for new files and documents, using a "Who-What-When" approach to standardize filenames based on who the file concerns, what it's about, and when the events or period are referred to. The filename should be descriptive enough without relying on associated metadata, enabling clear identification of its content.


 The text outlines guidelines for managing files, closures, emails, and private office records in an organizational context. Divisions should adopt suitable naming conventions based on these guidelines, while the Information & Records Management team ensures consistency. File closures occur when projects are disbanded or completed, requiring staff to officially close files on iShare with file plan managers. Re-opening of files is not advisable and needs approval from the Information & Records Management team. Access to Information requests involve responding from the document owner at the time of request, be it a project, program office, or business owner. Duplicate documents and unnecessary information should be deleted/destroyed, while handover notes for ongoing support and policy responsibility must include specific details about files. Emails containing official records should not be stored in Outlook folders but on iShare. Emails will automatically be deleted after 12 months, and recipients are responsible for ensuring crucial emails are captured on iShare. Sensitive information should only be sent in encrypted or secure emails, following the Cabinet Office's guidance on private email use. Records from Private Offices, including ministers and senior officials, need to adhere to the Public Records Act. The management of records created by Special Advisers requires separate consideration.


Special Advisers (SpAds) in the Welsh Government with wider roles impacting official business should retain their records. However, if their records mirror those already within the Welsh Government, there is no need to keep them as part of the official record. All party or parliamentary-related documents should be managed by Special Advisers separately. Private Offices under the Welsh Government must adhere to information and records management policies.

For the work of the Welsh European Funding Office (WEFO), all relevant financial and non-financial information should be retained, demonstrating compliance with EU rules and conditions. The retention period for beneficiaries is now linked to the Programme closure process and will generally be around 3 years following the end of an operation.

In handling sensitive personal data, a strong data protection culture is crucial along with adherence to GDPR and Data Protection Act 2018 principles. Personal data must be processed lawfully, fairly, and transparently for specified purposes. The information should be adequate, relevant, limited, accurate, and kept only as long as necessary for the intended purpose. Appropriate measures must be in place to safeguard individual rights when data is stored for longer periods for public interest, scientific research, or statistical purposes.


 The text discusses various aspects of handling sensitive and personal information, especially in a government context. It emphasizes that higher protection is given to sensitive data like criminal records, political opinions, religious beliefs, and union membership. A Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) and Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) are needed when dealing with personal data. A Privacy Notice must be provided, and compliance with data protection principles should be demonstrated.

Individuals have the right to access information held about them through a subject access request. In case of children, maturity to understand their rights and parental responsibility is considered before releasing information. The Welsh Government follows CCTV Code of Practice (ICO) when using cameras and keeps records only for as long as necessary.

The text also discusses data sharing protocols between the government and external organizations, which include specifying partners, information to be shared, management processes, storage principles, and access measures. Personal data sharing must be limited to what is required for processing.

Lastly, there are guidelines on sending data outside of the European Economic Area (EEA), particularly protecting or personal data. The requirement for hosting personal data within the EEA is detailed in the Project Managers' Security Handbook. Record management in collaborative projects or outsourcing situations is also highlighted as an area that requires attention.


 The text outlines guidelines for managing information and records within the Welsh Government. Staff should ensure shared information adheres to these policies, and third-party contracts must include reference to information management procedures. Collaborative or outsourced work's record handling should be agreed upon by all partners in a protocol, covering access to information, security, data quality, retention, disposal, and responsibilities for records related to requests. Assurances about how third-party suppliers handle information must be obtained, with a minimum requirement of the company obtaining Cyber Essentials for handling personal or OFFICIAL-SENSITIVE data.

The Welsh Government has developed an Open Data Plan by using the UK Government Licensing Framework and Open Government License to license public sector information reuse. The use of personal data must follow Data Protection legislation. 

For Machinery of Government changes and Function Transfers, the Departmental Records Officer must be informed promptly by the project lead. This ensures business records' transfer without data loss or interruption while following proper procedures and meeting legal requirements. Transfer documents should include file lists (regardless of format), outstanding requests, or sensitivity issues, with an official Transfer Agreement signed by both transferring and receiving organizations.


The text discusses various aspects related to the transfer and management of records and information during government restructuring processes. This includes handling records for public inquiries, reviews, and tribunals. Public inquiries must maintain adequate records ensuring accountability in evidence gathering, deliberation, and reporting. The Open Government Licence facilitates the reuse of public sector information without charge. The transfer of information between different legal entities requires a formal process.

Upon completion of an inquiry, its papers must be addressed immediately; there's no need to wait until they reach normal age for review. A documented search strategy for identifying and retrieving information during the inquiries will be coordinated with relevant policy departments.

The responsibility for records related to independent inquires or tribunals not under Welsh Government falls on these inquiry bodies. They are expected to ensure comprehensive, well-ordered records and adherence to appropriate policies and procedures.

For UK-wide and Welsh government inquiries and reviews investigating child abuse or other abuses, robust processes must be demonstrated, enabling referral of allegations to the relevant authorities and securely preserving the record. Appropriate retention periods based on GDPR and Data Protection Act 2018 should apply for abuse-related allegation records. An agreement with police about referrals and information sharing is necessary.

Finally, the text briefly introduces managing litigation or legal cases. This includes handling information subject to legal/document holds, hold orders, preservation orders, and other contexts requiring evidence from information or documents in legal settings.


 The text discusses legal obligations and processes for the Welsh Government in various contexts, such as obtaining legal advice, discovery during litigation, production in court, involvement in inquiries or legal proceedings, and management of data privacy. Employees must preserve information related to anticipated lawsuits or investigations by following instructions from designated officials like the Director of Governance, Data Protection Officer, Chief Digital Officer, and Departmental Records Officer (DRO). A litigation hold ensures that the Welsh Government preserves all electronic and paper information during legal proceedings or investigations. The duty to preserve information arises from common law spoliation prevention, statutes like the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and compliance with GDPR/DPA through data privacy impact assessments (PIAs).

The Welsh Government uses an eDiscovery tool to manage its information explosion, adhere to legal requests for discovery, determine what should be retained or deleted, and ensure compliance with data protection legislation. The duty of candour requires the organization to present a complete account of decision-making processes and provide all necessary details for fair determination in specific issues. The text also highlights that under the duty of disclosure, information about deleted documents must be revealed even if they are no longer retrievable.


The text outlines legal requirements for disclosure and information management within the context of the Welsh Government. The Duty of Disclosure involves a reasonable search for documents and declaration if a category is not searched due to it being unreasonable. Records are retained for the time necessary to support business needs and comply with legal obligations. Once this period ends, they may be destroyed or transferred to a Place of Deposit for permanent preservation. The Welsh Government's Retention and Disposal Schedule helps manage information efficiently by setting recommended retention periods for specific classes of information.

Personal data management is governed by the GDPR and Data Protection Act 2018, suggesting that after an applicable retention period, personal data can be anonymized instead of completely erased. To select records for transfer to The National Archives (TNA) or other Place of Deposit, the Public Records Act 1958 and Freedom of Information Act 2000 are followed. As per Constitutional Reform and Governance Act (CRAGA) 2010, a reduction in records disposal/transfer time was introduced from 30 to 20 years by 2013, set to complete by 2023 with records from that year. The progress is monitored through the Information Management Report published annually by The National Archives. The Government of Wales Acts (1998 & 2006) also address Welsh public records management.


 The text discusses the management and transfer of public records in Wales, Northern Ireland, and Scotland, governed by specific legislations such as Government of Wales Act 1998, Public Records Act (Northern Ireland) 1923, and Public Records (Scotland) Act 2011. In Wales, if requested, the UK Department of Media, Culture and Sport can make Welsh Ministers responsible for preserving records via a Section 147 Order. Despite not having its own national archive, the National Archives remains the recognized repository for Wales and UK government.

In Northern Ireland, the Public Record Office of Northern Ireland (PRONI) is the only public archive service and manages archives related to the region's government activities, including those from UK departments related to Northern Ireland. Scotland replaced the 1937 Public Records (Scotland) Act with the 2011 version. The National Records of Scotland (NRS), formed by merging General Register Office for Scotland and NAS in April 2011, is responsible for archives from national agencies, except Registrar General, parliament, law courts, and UK departments related to Scotland.

A selection process determines the records with historical value in these regions; those without are destroyed or retained by the relevant department. The final decision on which records should be transferred to respective archives happens after reviewing and validating appraisal decisions. Each region has its sensitivity review policy for managing such transfers.


 The text discusses the management and preservation of information within departments beyond certain periods, requiring a Retention Instrument from the Advisory Council to adhere to the Public Records Act. Ensuring access to digital information for short and long-term business needs is critical, thus a Digital Continuity project was conducted in 2010 to assess requirements and explore suitable solutions for preserving digital data. To maintain the accessibility and integrity of digital information, a process migrates iShare-stored data to updated software versions regularly.

The Welsh Government must own or acquire copyrights before adding documents to their information systems, as they cannot enter intellectual property of others unless given permission. The management system may be an Electronic Document and Records Management System (EDRMS), a shared drive, or bespoke platforms like SharePoint. This simultaneous access can constitute replication or broadcast under copyright laws, potentially opening government organizations to copyright infringement claims if the content was initially posted on social media sites claiming ownership of user-generated content.

Welsh Government historical records over 30 years old (now in the process of being reduced to 20 years) are held at the National Archives and can be accessed online via their catalogue. Information less than 30 years old requires a Freedom of Information Act request. The Welsh Government's external website also makes current information available for viewing online.


 The text outlines procedures for accessing and managing information within the Welsh Government. To comply with Freedom of Information Act and Re-use of Public Sector Information Regulations, research reports and publications are made available to the public through an external online Publications Catalogue managed by the Information & Archive Services team. Colleagues must email electronic Crown Copyright published material for catalogue inclusion within a month of publication. Legal Deposit ensures copies of print and digital Welsh Government publications go to British Library and National Library of Wales. A mandatory training course on information management is provided to all staff, who must complete it every two years or annually (depending on their roles). Information Management Assessments monitor compliance, with results reported in the Internal Control Questionnaire. When leaving employment, staff are responsible for ensuring proper handling of information and records they were working on, allowing for smooth succession without hindrance to accountability.


The text outlines guidelines for retaining and managing receipts, invoices, statements, and authorizations from Welsh Procurement Cards (WPC). Leavers should not keep any Welsh Government information. The user guide advises cardholders to request receipts always and not rely on credit card slips. Cardholders are instructed to scan or photograph these receipts, saving them into their iShare files while giving the files a title that corresponds with the description in BSM (Business Spend Management). If any details on the receipt are unclear or if an error is found, a note must be provided for clarification. Receipts must not be amended. 

The scanned or photographed records stored in iShare files should meet eligibility requirements and be retained for at least seven years after the end of the financial year in which the payment was made, or twelve years from the closure date of the relevant program if funded by an EU-funded program. These records are subject to inspection by authorized persons, such as internal inspection teams, auditors, managers, or HMRC (Her Majesty's Revenue & Customs). A unique reference number must be given to each invoice/receipt, entered into the description when saving the document in iShare, and also included in BSM's transaction description alongside a description of the purchased items. In cases without receipts, an explanation must be provided by cardholders and countersigned by the approver for logging purposes according to BSM guidelines. iShare-inaccessible cardholders can arrange for colleagues to upload their receipts or request physical files in exceptional circumstances.
