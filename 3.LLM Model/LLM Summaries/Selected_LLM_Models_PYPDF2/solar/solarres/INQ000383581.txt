A SAGE (Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies) meeting was held on January 22, 2020, regarding the Wuhan Coronavirus (WN-CoV). Updates were provided on declared cases, deaths, and geographical spread. China recently revised its case definitions, making comparison difficult, and diagnostic testing capacity in Wuhan is overwhelmed. There's considerable uncertainty about the data as many more cases are likely unreported. The WHO has received environmental samples from Wuhan, possibly revealing information on the zoonotic reservoir. Public transport from Wuhan was subsequently suspended following this meeting.

WN-CoV is shown to have person-to-person transmission, although its sustainability remains unknown. The incubation period ranges between 5 to 10 days, with a suggested outer limit of 14 days after contact. The reproductive number is currently estimated to be above 1 for WN-CoV, while the mortality rate appears lower than SARS, although further investigation is needed for accurate quantification.

NERVTAG (New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group) does not recommend port of entry screenings or questionnaires due to limited epidemiological understanding. However, NERVTAG supports public health information efforts via leaflets, posters, and broadcast messengers for passengers. SAGE agrees with NERVTAG's position on the value of port screening and monitoring measures, but would reconsider if a rapid test becomes available and deployable nationwide.

The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) recently published "Risk assessment guidelines for infectious diseases transmitted on aircraft", recommending the use of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) guidelines for the current outbreak despite limitations in evidence base. The UK currently has good centralized diagnostic capacity and is days away from a scalable WN-CoV test nationwide, though its sensitivity remains unknown.


The text outlines discussions and actions by the UK's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE) regarding the potential spread of Wuhan novel coronavirus (WN-CoV). The sensitivity of diagnostic tests from upper respiratory tract sampling remains unknown. The Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) is developing advice for testing potentially infected individuals, including those with symptoms or signs of WN-CoV and a history in Wuhan within the past two weeks. SAGE deemed this appropriate but advised revisions as needed due to evolving circumstances.

Preparations for isolating potential cases and following up contacts are underway by DHSC and Public Health England (PHE). The Chief Medical Officer (CMO) is asked to share a PHE isolation plan with behavioral scientists to gauge its proportionality and for advice on communicating uncertainties. The CMO, along with DHSC and PHE, are also directed to consider how NHS primary care facilities might respond to an increase in cases. 

The CMO and the Foreign & Commonwealth Office (FCO) need to work together on consistent travel advice to and from Wuhan. There are no practical preventative measures for HMG ahead of the Chinese New Year. DHSC has outlined triggers, including infection in healthcare workers and probable human-to-human transmission; however, geographical spread unconnected to Wuhan is not a current trigger.

In the event of person-to-person spread of WN-CoV outside China or severe confirmed cases in the UK, HMG should review its response according to SAGE. The CMO shares the isolation plan with select participants, considers communication strategies, and works with DHSC and PHE to evaluate NHS primary care facilities' preparedness for an increase in cases. Collaboration between the CMO, DHSC, and FCO ensures consistency in travel advice.
