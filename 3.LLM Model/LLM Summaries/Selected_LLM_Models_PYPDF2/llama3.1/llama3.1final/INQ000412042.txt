Title: INQ000412042 - Presentation from UK Covid-19 Inquiry, titled module 2B data and charts, dated between 01/01/2020 and 01/04/2022.

This text appears to be a data-driven summary of COVID-19 statistics in Wales and England, from April 2020 to February 2024. Here's a brief summary:

**Daily Deaths and Excess Mortality:**

* The number of daily deaths involving COVID-19 on death certificates in Wales has generally decreased since the first wave of the pandemic.
* Excess mortality (deaths above average) was highest during the first wave (32%) and lowest during the second wave (21%).
* In 2020, there were 2,109 and 4,429 deaths involving COVID-19 in Wales, with excess deaths of 2,251 and 3,187.
* Five-year average daily deaths have recovered to pre-pandemic levels.

**Hospitalization:**

* The number of weekly hospital patients with COVID-19 in Wales dropped significantly from April 2020 to February 2024.

**New Cases and Infections:**

* New cases of COVID-19 per day in Wales were at their highest in January 2021, then declined.
* Estimated percentage of the population testing positive for COVID-19 has fluctuated between 2% and 10%.

**Age-Specific Death Rates and Excess Deaths by Place:**

* Age-specific death rates involving COVID-19 have varied across five-year age groups, with mortality highest in older age groups (85+).
* Excess deaths compared to usual levels were most pronounced at home (30%) and least so in hospitals (-10%).

**Time-Series Plot:**

* The text includes several time-series plots showing trends in daily deaths, excess mortality, new cases, hospitalizations, and estimated population testing positive.

The data suggests that the COVID-19 situation in Wales has improved significantly since April 2020, with declining numbers of daily deaths, hospitalizations, and new cases. However, it is essential to continue monitoring these metrics to assess the ongoing impact of the pandemic on public health.
