Title: INQ000385719 - Email chain between Rob Orford (Chief Scientific Adviser for Health, Welsh Government), Frank Atherton (Chief Medical Officer for Wales), Tracey Cooper (Chief Executive of Public Health Wales) and colleagues, regarding PHW/WG - National assessment, dated between 10/11/2020 and 11/10/2020.

The text appears to be an email sent by Tracey, with the content provided by Rob (whose email is forwarded at the bottom). The email contains a guide for discussion points ahead of a meeting scheduled for 2pm on October 11th.

The main discussion points are:

1. Identifying a key strategic intent for Wales in dealing with COVID-19: whether to aim for elimination or suppression until vaccines/treatment become available.
2. Discussing the current situation and where it is headed over the next few weeks, including rising case incidence and hospital admissions.
3. Examining global experiences of countries that have successfully controlled the spread of the virus: stringent border control, functional test-trace-isolate programs, financial incentives for isolation, and clear messaging to the public.
4. Exploring options for dealing with COVID-19 in Wales, including continuing with local lockdowns or introducing additional national interventions.

The meeting invitation is also included at the end, for interested parties.
