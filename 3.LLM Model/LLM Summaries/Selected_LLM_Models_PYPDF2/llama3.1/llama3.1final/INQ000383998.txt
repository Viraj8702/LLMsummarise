Title: INQ000383998 - Email chain between Dr Rob Orford (Chief Scientific Adviser for Health, Welsh Government), PS Minister of Health and Social Services and colleagues, regarding Welsh National COVID 19 Test Plan, dated 27/03/2020.

Here is a summary of the text:

The Minister for Health and Social Services has approved the Wales COVID-19 testing plan, but would like some additional information before it can be published. The Plan outlines various dates for the delivery and go-live of different testing equipment, including 4 Starlet platforms and 6 Nimbus machines.

The Minister has several questions regarding the testing numbers, specifically how they were generated and whether they are reliant on UK initiatives. The response provides explanations and details on the increasing capacity to perform COVID-19 tests in Wales:

* Testing capacity will increase from 500 to 800, then to 1100, and finally to 6000 per day by May
* This is an expansion of Welsh capacity, with a fallback plan relying on other UK initiatives

The Minister also wants the Plan to highlight Wales' positive position compared to other UK nations. A Decision Report, which summarizes the Plan for announcement purposes, will be published soon.
