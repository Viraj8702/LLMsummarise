Title: INQ000350513 - Email chain between Chris Whitty (Chief Medical Officer for England, UK Government), Frank Atherton (Chief Medical Officer, Welsh Government), Rob Orford (Chief Scientific Adviser for Health, Welsh Government) and colleagues, regarding an overview of UK Strategy, dated 22/03/2020.

The text appears to be a personal communication between individuals discussing COVID-19 strategy, specifically regarding the UK's response. The main points summarized are:

* The author does not agree with the current strategy and proposes an alternative approach:
	+ "Maximum short-term suppression" through severe lockdown measures
	+ Aggressive testing, isolation, and release strategy
	+ Immediate containment within households by limiting social mixing
* This proposed approach aims to reduce hospital admissions and implement community testing and control methods within a short time frame (4-8 weeks)
* The author warns that the public needs to be aware of the potential for hospitals to become overwhelmed (as seen in Italy) and must take an active role in winning this battle with COVID-19
* A "short sharp" lockdown would be followed by traditional methods of controlling communicable diseases on a larger scale, but with greater urgency
