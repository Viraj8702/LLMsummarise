Title: INQ000350691 - Statement by Jane Hutt (Deputy First Minister) and Welsh Government, titled Statement to mark the International Day of Disabled People, dated 01/12/2020.

Here is a summary of the text:

The Welsh Government marks the International Day of Disabled People (December 3) with a statement from Jane Hutt MS, Deputy Minister. The pandemic has highlighted existing problems that disproportionately affect people with disabilities, including isolation, lack of access to services, and socioeconomic disadvantage. In Wales, 68% of COVID-related deaths were in disabled communities, with those with learning disabilities being most affected. The Welsh Government recognizes the importance of addressing disablism in its policies and practices. The statement highlights the need for a more inclusive approach to recovery from the pandemic and proposes initiatives such as a fund to support disabled people seeking elected office in Wales, to increase participation in local democracy. The aim is also to appoint Disabled People Employment Champions to promote economic inclusion of people with disabilities.


Here is a summary of the text:

The Welsh government is launching several initiatives to support disabled people and improve employment opportunities for them. A new role, the "Disabled People Employment Champions", will be created to support employers across Wales in creating an inclusive workforce. The government is also launching a toolkit called "A More Equal Wales" to help employers do this.

Additionally, Â£200,000 of funding has been allocated from the Welsh Government's Reserves for Reconstruction package to fund disability projects and small grants to nine Disabled People's Organizations (DPOs) across Wales. This money will be used to support vital work, provide information and advice, and develop new ways to respond to the COVID-19 needs of disabled people.

The government is also revisiting the "Action on Disability" framework launched in 2019 and aims to use lessons learned from the pandemic to inform its refresh. A report led by Professor Debbie Foster will gather evidence and case studies on the impact of COVID on disabled people, which will be used to inform a revised framework. The Welsh government is inviting all Senedd members to celebrate the contribution of disabled people in Wales on the United Nation's International Day of Disabled People.
