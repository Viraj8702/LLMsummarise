Overall, the guidelines aim to ensure proper management and retention of electronic and hardcopy records within the Welsh Government.


Here is a summary of the text:

The Welsh Government has policies in place regarding the retention and disposal of public records, including digital ones such as websites, social media, and electronic messages like emails and texts. These records are either destroyed or preserved permanently at the National Archives after a specified period.

Regarding digital communication tools:

* Staff using government phones for messaging create "public records", which must be properly managed and preserved.
* The ephemeral nature of text messages requires staff to be aware that they may be creating public records, which can cause record management challenges such as identifying, capturing, and preserving content, managing access and retrieval, and determining retention periods.

Regarding specific digital tools:

* Welsh Government websites are archived through the UK Web Archive and made accessible via the UK Government Web Archive.
* Staff must use Microsoft Teams (which replaces instant messaging and other tools) to send messages that will be hosted by the Welsh Government and retained for 30 days. Business decisions, finance decisions, or policy decisions should not be made using this tool.

The policies require staff to follow rules regarding social media usage, record management, and digital communication to ensure transparency, access, and preservation of public records.

2. **Private Offices and EU Funded Records management**: The text advises that Private Offices must adhere to Welsh Government's information and records management policies and practices. Specifically, it outlines the necessity of retaining relevant information and supporting documents related to the work of the Welsh European Funding Office (WEFO) until WEFO confirms they are no longer required.

3. **Retention periods for EU Funded Records**: For these records, retention is not linked to programme closure but instead averages around 5-10 years from when expenditure has been declared, with most operations' files kept for about 3 years after their end.

4. **Protecting Sensitive Personal Information**: Adherence to data protection principles outlined in the GDPR and Data Protection Act 2018 is stressed, focusing on lawful processing that ensures transparency, accuracy, relevance, sufficiency, and non-retention beyond necessity.


Here's a summary of the text:

* Requires documentation and agreements for transferring records between departments or organizations


The text discusses how to manage various types of government records, including Public Inquiries, Reviews, Tribunals, and legal cases. Here is a summary:

* When the "Machinery of Government" process changes, it's essential to transfer information and records as part of the implementation.

* Records from Public Inquiries are typically transferred to The National Archives (TNA) for preservation.
* For cases involving child or other abuse allegations, the Welsh Government must demonstrate robust procedures for handling such claims, including proper record-keeping and information sharing protocols with the police.

Overall, the text emphasizes the importance of maintaining accurate and accountable records in various government contexts.


The text provides a summary of procedures and guidelines related to litigation in the Welsh Government. Specifically:

* When involved in an inquiry or legal proceedings, employees must contact the Director of Governance, Data Protection Officer, Chief Digital Officer, and Departmental Records Officer (DRO) to ensure preservation of relevant information.
* A "litigation hold" is established to preserve records and information that may be relevant to pending or anticipated lawsuits or investigations.
* Organizations are required by law to preserve information when anticipating a lawsuit or investigation, to prevent spoliation of evidence and comply with statutes such as the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.
* Data Privacy Impact Assessments (PIAs) should be performed before releasing sensitive personal information to redact non-relevant data in compliance with GDPR/DPA regulations.

Additionally, the text discusses two related topics:

* Legal Discovery: The Welsh Government has an eDiscovery tool to assist in managing and coping with public inquiries, court cases, and internal investigations.
* Candour: As a public authority, the Welsh Government has a duty of candour to provide full and fair accounts of decision-making processes, including information and documents that may be relevant to claims or challenges.


Here is a summary of the text:

The Welsh Government has policies in place to manage data retention and disposal. The duty of disclosure requires parties to search for documents and disclose their existence if they exist. Information and records are only retained as long as necessary for business requirements and legal obligations, after which they are destroyed or transferred to a permanent archive.

The government also follows rules regarding the retention of personal data under the GDPR and Data Protection Act 2018. Once applicable retention periods expire, personal data can be anonymized instead of erased, and steps such as deletion, erasure, separation from identifying information, or aggregation can be taken.

Additionally, the Welsh Government has a schedule for transferring records to archival storage based on their age, with a reduction in transfer ages from 30 to 20 years over time. The government reports annually on its progress in meeting record transfer objectives.


Here is a summary of the text:

The Government of Wales Act 1998 transferred responsibility for preserving Welsh records from the National Archives (TNA) in England to the UK's Department for Media, Culture and Sport (DCMS). However, an arrangement with TNA remains in place due to cost prohibitions on creating a separate national archive in Wales. The DCMS can create an Order under section 147 of the Act to transfer this responsibility, but for now, Welsh records are stored at TNA alongside UK government records.

The situation is similar in Scotland and Northern Ireland, where the National Records of Scotland (NRS) and the Public Record Office of Northern Ireland (PRONI) respectively have custodianship of national archives. Similar arrangements exist with TNA, allowing public bodies to retain certain records while transferring others for preservation and storage.

In Wales specifically, a review process is used to select which records are transferred to TNA, with input from relevant departments on what records have historical value or need retention for ongoing business use.


Here is a summary of the text:

This section appears to be part of an information management guide for the Welsh Government.

**Retention and Preservation**: The Welsh Government must obtain permission from the Advisory Council if it wishes to retain records beyond the standard retention periods (unless they have a long-term business need or are subject to an ongoing inquiry). A Digital Continuity project was conducted to assess digital preservation requirements and ensure access to and integrity of digital information.

**Intellectual Property**: The Welsh Government must obtain copyright permission before entering external intellectual property into its systems, such as iShare. Staff cannot scan or enter documentation without ensuring the Welsh Government owns or has obtained the copyright.

**Public Access to Records**: The public can access Welsh Government records through:

* The National Archives' online catalogue (for historical records over 30 years old)
* Freedom of Information Requests (for less than 30-year-old information)

Overall, this section highlights the importance of proper retention and preservation of records, managing intellectual property rights, and providing access to Welsh Government records through established channels.
