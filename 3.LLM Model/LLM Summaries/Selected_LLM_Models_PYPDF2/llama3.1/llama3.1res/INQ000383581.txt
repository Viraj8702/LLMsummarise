Here is a summary of the text:

**SAGE Meeting Update**

The SAGE meeting on January 22, 2020 updated the situation regarding the Wuhan Coronavirus (WN-CoV). Key points include:

* Cases and deaths are rising in China, with many more cases likely than reported
* The incubation period is unclear, but transmission appears person-to-person
* The reproductive number is believed to be above 1, indicating rapid spread
* Mortality rate is currently lower than SARS, but too early to quantify
* Travel restrictions and public health information efforts are recommended, but port screening is not advised due to limited understanding of epidemiology or lack of a specific, simple, and rapid test.

**Key Points**

* WHO has environmental sampling from Wuhan, which may provide more insight into the virus's origin
* Authorities in Wuhan announced suspension of public transport on January 23
* The UK has good centralized diagnostic capacity for WN-CoV and is near developing a scalable, specific test


There is no text to summarize other than a document detailing discussions and actions related to the response of the UK government (DHSC) and Public Health England (PHE) to a potential or actual outbreak of a new coronavirus (WN-CoV). 

Some key points from the text include:

* The sensitivity of tests for the virus is unknown, and there are conflicting reports on its effectiveness.
* Guidelines are being developed for healthcare workers to identify and test potentially infected individuals.
* DHSC, PHE, and other agencies are preparing plans for isolating potentially infected individuals and following up contacts.
* The UK government (DHCS) is considering plans for the NHS primary care facilities in case of a surge in cases.

However, please note that this seems more like an agenda or minutes from a meeting rather than a full text to summarize.
