Here is a summary of the witness statement provided by Dr Chris Williams, Consultant Epidemiologist at Public Health Wales:

The statement discusses COVID-19 hospital admission and intensive care data for Wales from February 1, 2020 to June 26, 2022. A "COVID-19 case" is defined as someone who has tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 PCR in Wales.

The data shows the number of COVID-19 cases admitted to hospital and intensive care for each of the health boards in Wales during this period. The statement notes that not all admissions were necessarily related to the patient's COVID-19 test, but rather 3 in 5 were given a diagnosis consistent with the virus.

Some key statistics from the data include:

* A total of nearly 24,000 COVID-19 case admissions to hospitals in Wales over approximately 16 months.
* Cwm Taf Morgannwg UHB had the highest number of case admissions (21% of total cases admitted).
* Aneurin Bevan, Betsi Cadwaladr, and Cardiff and Vale University Health Boards had similar numbers of admissions.
* The data is provided with some limitations, such as the possibility that patient addresses may have changed since their COVID-19 test.

The statement also notes that the first recorded COVID-19 case in Wales was confirmed on February 27, 2020.


Here is a summary of the text:

The report discusses COVID-19 cases admitted to hospitals and intensive care units in Wales over a 16-month period (March 2020 to June 2022). Key points include:

* The number of COVID-19 cases admitted to hospital has varied significantly over time, with initial peaks at the end of March 2020 and late December 2020/early January 2021.
* Subsequent smaller peaks occurred from Autumn 2021 onwards.
* Variations in case admissions are influenced by changes in incidence rates, testing availability, variant severity, vaccination roll-out, and community disease management.
* The "fire-break" intervention introduced in autumn 2020 caused a notch in hospital case admissions.
* Cwm Taf Morgannwg UHB had the highest number of COVID-19 cases admitted to intensive care units (22% of total ICU admissions).
* Peak intensive care admissions reflect the timing of hospital case peaks.

The report includes two figures showing weekly numbers of confirmed COVID-19 cases admitted to hospital and intensive care during the specified period.


The text discusses the number of COVID-19 patients admitted to hospital and intensive care units (ICUs) in different regions of Wales, as reported by various Health Boards. Here is a summary:

* The height of peak ICU admissions decreased with each subsequent wave (corresponding to waves of the pandemic), suggesting improvements in patient treatment and management, as well as widespread vaccination.
* While there were some small variations between Health Boards, all experienced peak case admissions at roughly the same time. However, there were larger differences in case admissions between wave 2 and later waves.
* Cwm Taf Morgannwg UHB had the highest number of ICU admissions during wave 2, while Betsi Cadwaladr UHB had higher cases early in autumn 2021. Hywel Dda UHB consistently reported lower case admissions compared to other Health Boards.
* Due to small numbers of weekly intensive care case admissions after the first two waves (corresponding to the end of 2020 and beginning of 2021), data became difficult to interpret.

Overall, while there were differences in case admissions between regions, these tended to diminish with each wave, likely reflecting the impact of improved treatments, management practices, and vaccination efforts.


The text appears to be discussing COVID-19 cases and hospital admissions in Wales, specifically within the regions served by the Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board (BC UHB) and Aneurin Bevan University Health Board (formerly referred to as organnwg UHB). The key points are:

* In 2020-2022, COVID-19 cases admitted to hospital were highest in those aged 60-79 years, which made up more than one-third of all admissions.
* This age group also had the highest number of intensive care (ICU) admissions, accounting for 45% of ICU admissions.
* The oldest age groups (80 and over) had the lowest rate of ICU admissions, not necessarily due to less severe disease, but because older patients are less likely to benefit from ICU support.
* In younger age groups (0-19 and 20-39), hospital admissions increased over time, whereas in older age groups, cases admitted decreased with each subsequent wave after the second wave.
* This trend is attributed to changes in immunity through vaccination and infection, as well as changes in virus epidemiology.


It appears that the provided text is a jumbled collection of characters and symbols, which likely resulted from formatting issues or a corrupted document. As a result, I was unable to make sense of the content.

However, based on the occasional appearance of numerical values, tables, and reference numbers (e.g., "Figure 7", "Table 3"), it is clear that the text pertains to a study about COVID-19 admissions to hospitals and intensive care units. There may be information on age demographics, sex distribution, and admission patterns over two or more waves of the virus.

If you provide a reformatted version of the text or clarify what you would like me to focus on (e.g., demographics, hospital vs. ICU admissions, etc.), I'll do my best to summarize it for you.


The text provides information about COVID-19 cases admitted to intensive care and hospital in Wales, broken down by sex and deprivation level.

Key points include:

* In the waves of COVID-19, there have consistently been more male cases admitted to intensive care than female.
* The reduction in ICU admissions observed was mainly due to a decline in male cases in Wales.
* There is a strong correlation between deprivation and COVID-19 hospitalizations, with 26% of admitted cases residing in the most deprived quintile, compared to 15% in the least deprived.
* In intensive care case admissions, 27% were from the most deprived quintile, versus 13% from the least deprived.
* Within each deprivation quintile, the percentage of patients admitted to ICU was similar, but higher for those in the most deprived areas (8.7%) and lower for those in the least deprived (7.6%).
* Definitions for hospital and intensive care inpatient cases were provided, suggesting a possible distinction between these metrics.

The rest of the text appears to be technical definitions and extraction methods related to COVID-19 data used in Wales.


This text appears to be a part of a research paper or report, specifically focusing on COVID-19 hospital inpatient data from Wales. Here's a summary:

* The study extracted data from March 2020 onwards, including PCR test results and hospital admissions.
* It analyzed the number of COVID-19 cases and intensive care unit (ICU) patients over time.
* The findings show that:
	+ The number of COVID-19 inpatients peaked twice: once in Winter 2020/21 with around 2,000 cases, and again in subsequent autumn waves with increasing numbers each time.
	+ ICU admissions also had two major peaks, one in April 2020 (around 100 cases) and another in January 2021 (similarly around 100 cases).
	+ Since November 2021, there's been a general decrease in intensive care COVID-19 inpatients.

The report seems to provide detailed graphs and figures to support these findings. Overall, the study aims to present an analysis of hospital data on COVID-19 patients in Wales during this period.


Unfortunately, it appears that there is no actual text for me to summarize. The passage you provided seems to be a collection of code characters and unrelated statistics, along with some graphics and tables.

If I had to take a wild guess, the topic appears to be related to COVID-19 hospitalization data in Wales, divided by health board. However, without any actual text or meaningful information, I'm not sure what specific points to summarize.

Could you please clarify or provide more context about where this passage came from and what it's supposed to mean? I'll do my best to help!


It appears that the text is a data analysis report on COVID-19 hospitalization trends in Wales. Here's a summary of the key points:

* In one week in January 2021, there were approximately 900 COVID-19 inpatients aged 80 years or older in Welsh hospitals.
* The 60-79 age group consistently had more cases admitted for COVID-19, while the 80+ age group consistently had more inpatient cases overall.
* The highest number of intensive care unit (ICU) cases were predominantly from the 60-79 and 40-59 age groups, with very few ICU cases from the youngest and oldest age groups.
* Over time, there was a small increase in inpatients in the youngest age group.

These findings suggest that older adults were disproportionately affected by COVID-19 hospitalizations, particularly those aged 80 years or older.


Here is the summary:

The text discusses data on COVID-19 hospitalizations in Wales, focusing on differences between male and female patients. Key points include:

* Over time, there have been consistently more female COVID-19 hospital inpatients than males, but the difference has been small.
* In contrast, over the first two waves of the pandemic, there were significantly more male hospital inpatients than females.
* As the pandemic progressed, numbers on both male and female hospitalizations decreased, eliminating the large sex-based differences observed earlier.
* Unfortunately, it is not possible to analyze data by other protected characteristics (e.g., ethnicity) due to incomplete information in the dataset.
* The text also provides a table showing population estimates by Health Board in Wales from 2021.

Overall, the text appears to be an extract from a report or document related to hospitalization data for COVID-19 patients in Wales.
