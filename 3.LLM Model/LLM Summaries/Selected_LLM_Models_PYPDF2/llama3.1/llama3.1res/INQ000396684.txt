Here's a summary of the text:

The text outlines two models for private offices and record-keeping within a government department.

**Model 1: Recommended Approach**

This model requires both the Private Office and the relevant policy area to keep records of decisions, comments, and communications. The Private Office must ensure that all key records are captured and stored in the departmental records system, while also conveying comments and annotations back to the policy area. This model emphasizes risk management and accountability.

**Model 2: Reliance on Policy Areas**

In this model, the policy areas take full responsibility for retaining and storing records within the departmental record system. The Private Office is not required to capture all records in the departmental system, but rather delegates this task to the responsible policy area.

The text emphasizes the importance of transparency, accountability, and risk management in both models. It also highlights the need for a single, centralized document retention system to ensure that key information is preserved and accessible.
