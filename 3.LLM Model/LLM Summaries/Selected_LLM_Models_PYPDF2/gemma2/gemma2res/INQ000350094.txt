This text is a series of email exchanges about post-firebreak restrictions in Wales, particularly those affecting non-essential businesses.  

**Key points:**

* **Tier 4 Restrictions:** Leisure and fitness facilities will be closed in Tier 4.
* **Supermarket Restrictions:** The only potential restriction on supermarkets in Tier 4 may be the sale of non-essential items. Clarification on this point is pending. 
* **DMfE&T's Requests:** Lee Waters, Deputy Minister for Economy and Transport, requests updates on decisions regarding gyms in Tier 4 and supermarket restrictions across different tiers. 
* **Oversight:**  The email reveals that the First Minister's (FM) decisions on these matters weren't communicated to other ministers. Apologies are offered for this oversight.

**Further details:**

* The emails also discuss specifics about unlicenced music events and Penalties for businesses, but this is not central to the summary focusing on non-essential items.


In summary, Lee Waters wants clarification on the sale of non-essential items in supermarkets during Tier 4 restrictions and is awaiting updates on decisions regarding gyms and supermarket limitations across various tiers.  



This email summarizes a meeting regarding proposed changes to Fixed Penalty Notices (FPNs) related to COVID-19 regulations in Wales. Key points include:

*  **Decreased FPN for international travel self-isolation:** The initial fine will be reduced from £1000 to £500, rising on subsequent occasions.
* **Increased FPN for large gatherings:** The initial fine for organizing events with more than 15 people indoors or 30 outdoors will increase from £200 to £500.

* **Decreased FPN for international travel operators:** This will be reduced from a fixed £4000 to an initial £1000, rising on subsequent occasions.

* **Further Review on "Reckless" Breaches of Self-Isolation:** The First Minister is unconvinced about introducing a new offense for "reckless" breaches of self-isolation guidelines, similar to the international travel penalty. More consultation with stakeholders will be conducted.

* **Review of Enforcement Roles and Responsibilities:** A systematic review will ensure clarity on the roles of different enforcing authorities for each COVID-19 related offense. 


Further discussions are planned with enforcement agencies to clarify which offenses are most serious and ensure appropriate law enforcement responses.



This text summarizes a meeting discussion regarding proposed changes to Fixed Penalty Notices (FPNs) for various Covid-19 related offenses.  

**Key points:**

* **Initial Proposal:** A review recommended raising some FPN amounts, particularly for failing to self-isolate after international travel (£200 proposed to £500) and organizing events of over 15 people indoors or 30 outdoors (£60 proposed to £500). This was to create more consistency with other areas and deter house parties due to their high risk.
* **Counterpoint:** The First Minister ultimately declined to approve these changes without further discussion, specifically requesting:
    * The Chief Constable's (CG) opinion on the matter.
    * More details about the reasoning behind not imposing additional penalties for unlicensed music events, especially regarding England's approach and the potential impact of court-level penalties.



**Overall:** The text highlights a back-and-forth discussion surrounding Covid-19 enforcement measures. While initial proposals aimed to increase penalties for specific offenses due to their risk, the First Minister sought more input before making a final decision. 



This email from the Senior Private Secretary to the First Minister of Wales outlines urgent next steps regarding a review of post-firebreak COVID-19 restrictions.

**Key points:**

* **Review of fixed penalty notices (FPN):** A key issue is court level penalties for FPN violations in comparison to England.  
    * The author seeks clarification on whether this difference impacts Welsh police perspectives. 
    * Ministerial input is required before proceeding.
* **Other proposals:** Less controversial parts of the review will await ministerial feedback before a final decision. 
* **Timelines:** 
    * A final decision by the First Minister is desired for Monday.
    * The attached advice document focuses on the first phase of the post-firebreak restriction review.
    * A translation of the draft Written Statement in Welsh will be provided tomorrow.


Essentially, the email highlights a need for expedited internal consultation and ministerial input to reach a decision about post-firebreak restrictions and FPNs by the upcoming deadline.
