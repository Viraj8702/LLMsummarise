**Security:**

The document emphasizes that SECRET and TOP SECRET information must be handled according to the Information Security Policy. Storing such sensitive data on network drives may require exceptions based on justification.



Essentially, this document provides a roadmap for managing information within the Welsh Government, highlighting designated systems for different purposes and reinforcing security protocols. 



This document outlines information management procedures within the Welsh Government, emphasizing electronic storage and accessibility through the iShare system.

**Key points:**

* **iShare is the primary system:** All staff have access to personal folders and shared spaces. Corporate information should be stored exclusively in registered files within iShare. Temporary files reside in MyTemp folders with automatic deletion after 7 days of inactivity.
* **External Collaboration through Connect:**  Connect is a tool for sharing information with external stakeholders, but the actual information must be stored within registered iShare files.
* **Email handling:** Emails of transitory nature should be deleted after action. Those pertaining to transactions or evidence require saving in iShare immediately.
* **Transition to Electronic Records:** Information from other systems (case management, grant management, etc.) should be migrated to iShare whenever possible.

**Hardcopy Handling Policy:**

* Hardcopies are accepted for SECRET and TOP SECRET classifications only.  
* Scanning is now standard practice for incoming documents, including those with signatures. 
* T&S receipts can be scanned or photographed and saved in iShare. 
* Since April 1st, 2019, records related to Welsh Procurement Card transactions must be retained electronically.

**Important Considerations:**

* Maintaining hardcopies beyond necessary reference purposes is strongly discouraged due to security, GDPR compliance, and data management risks.
