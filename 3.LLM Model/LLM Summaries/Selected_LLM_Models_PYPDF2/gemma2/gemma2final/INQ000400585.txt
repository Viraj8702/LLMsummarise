Title: INQ000400585 - Witness statement provided by Dr Christopher Williams on behalf of Public Health Wales,  dated 19/01/2024.

Dr. Chris Williams, a Consultant Epidemiologist at Public Health Wales, provided this witness statement in response to requests for COVID-19 hospital admission data from February 1st, 2020, to June 26th, 2022. 

The statement defines how Public Health Wales identifies COVID-19 cases (positive PCR tests) and hospital admissions (admission at least once in 28 days after a positive test). It reveals that approximately three out of five SARS-CoV-2 positive hospital admissions likely had diagnoses unrelated to the virus. The data analysis method is outlined, including sources and potential limitations.

Key findings include:

* Nearly 24,000 COVID-19 cases were admitted to hospitals in Wales over a period of 16 months.
* Cwm Taf Morgannwg UHB had the highest number of admissions (21% of total cases).
* Aneurin Bevan, Betsi Cadwaladr, and Cardiff and Vale UHBs reported similar admission levels between 18-20% of the total.

The statement provides detailed hospitalization figures broken down by Welsh Health Board, allowing for further analysis of COVID-19's impact across different regions.


This summary condenses 
the key information presented in Dr. Williams' statement regarding COVID-19 hospital admissions in Wales.


This text provides data on COVID-19 hospital and intensive care admissions in Wales from March 2020 to June 2022.

**Key findings:**

* **Variations in admissions:** The number of COVID-19 cases admitted to hospitals and intensive care units fluctuated significantly over the period, with peaks occurring in late March/early April 2020, late December 2020/early January 2021, and sporadically from Autumn 2021 onwards.
* **Regional differences:**  Hospital admissions varied across health board regions. Cwm Taf Morgannwg UHB had the highest intensive care admissions (22% of total), while Swansea Bay and Hywel Dda UHBs reported the lowest.

**Factors influencing admission numbers:**

* **Disease incidence:** Peaks in hospital admissions mirrored peaks in overall COVID-19 cases.
* **Testing availability:** Changes in testing practices likely influenced case detection and reporting.
* **Variant severity:** Different variants had varying levels of disease severity, impacting admission rates.
* **Vaccination campaigns:** The rollout of vaccines contributed to a decline in admissions over time.
* **Public health measures:** Interventions like the "fire-break" lockdown in autumn 2020 led to noticeable drops in admissions.


**Noteworthy trend:**

* A pronounced dip in hospital admissions during the "fire-break" period (October/November 2020) highlights the effectiveness of public health interventions.



The text emphasizes the dynamic nature of COVID-19 transmission and its impact on hospitalizations, influenced by a complex interplay of factors.


The text analyzes COVID-19 hospitalizations and ICU admissions in Wales from March 2020 to June 2022.  

**Key findings:**

* **Improved Outcomes:** Each pandemic wave saw a lower peak in hospital admissions, likely due to improved patient treatment, widespread vaccination, and reduced severity of later variants.
* **Correlated Peaks:**  While there were slight timing differences between health boards, overall peaks in hospital admissions occurred simultaneously across Wales. 
* **Board Variability:** 
    * Hywel Dda UHB consistently had lower hospitalization numbers than other boards.
    * Cwm Taf Morgannwg UHB initially experienced the highest admissions (wave 2), but Betsi Cadwaladr UHB took the lead later on. 
    * Wave 2 showed greater differences in case admissions between health boards compared to later waves.

 **Intensive Care Admissions:**

* Data is less reliable due to small numbers, particularly after the first two waves.
* Betsi Cadwaladr and Hywel Dda UHBs had fewer intensive care admissions in the first wave compared to other major health boards.


The figures included in the text provide a visual representation of these trends across different health boards and time periods. 



This text analyzes COVID-19 hospital and intensive care admissions in Wales from March 2020 to June 2022, focusing on age group trends.

**Key findings:**

* **Admissions highest in older adults:** The 60-79 age group consistently had the most hospital admissions (over a third of all cases) and intensive care admissions (45% of total).
* **Lowest admissions in young adults:** Those aged 0-19 experienced the fewest admissions, comprising only 6% of hospital cases.
* **Intensive care admissions vary:** While older adults had the highest number of intensive care cases, the highest proportion of admissions admitted to intensive care (17%) was in the 40-59 age group.
* **Trends over time:**
    * Admissions remained consistently high in the 60-79 age group.
    * Cases among younger adults (0-19 and 20-39) generally increased over time, likely due to changing immunity from vaccination and infection, virus mutations, and epidemiology shifts.

**Additional notes:**

* The text acknowledges that reduced intensive care admissions in the oldest age group might not reflect less severe disease but rather limited capacity for benefitting from such care due to overall poorer health outcomes associated with advanced age and comorbidities.
* The data analyzes trends across multiple waves of the pandemic, visually represented by figures displaying weekly admissions changes over time.

This report emphasizes the vulnerability of older adults to COVID-19 requiring higher healthcare utilization while also highlighting how younger cohorts became increasingly affected with time.


This text appears to be a statistical report about COVID-19 cases, particularly focusing on hospital and intensive care admissions. 

Here's a breakdown of the information presented:

* **Age Groups:** Hospital and ICU admissions were highest in the 40-59 and 60-79 age groups, with significant reductions following the second wave.
* **Sex:** More females were admitted to hospitals (51%), while males accounted for 63% of intensive care admissions.
* **Trends Over Time:** Initially, more males were hospitalized than females. However, from early 2022 onwards, there were more female cases admitted than male.

The report utilizes charts and tables to visualize the data, but the visual elements are not accessible in this text-only format.  


Unfortunately, without the complete visuals (Figures 7 and 8) and precise context about the dataset (location, time period), it's difficult to provide a more detailed analysis.



This text presents data on COVID-19 hospitalizations and intensive care admissions in Wales from March 1, 2020, to June 26, 2022. 

Here are some key findings:

* **Gender:** More male cases were admitted to intensive care compared to females across the different waves of the pandemic. This difference was particularly pronounced during the first two waves.
* **Deprivation:** Both hospital and intensive care admissions increased with rising deprivation levels, as measured by the Welsh Index of Multiple Deprivation (WIMD). The most deprived quintile had significantly higher admission rates than the least deprived quintile. 
* **Intensive Care Rate:**  The percentage of hospital inpatients admitted to intensive care was similar across different deprivation levels, though highest in the most deprived quintile.
* **Data Definitions:** 

The text also defines  "COVID-19 hospital inpatient" and "COVID-19 intensive care inpatient," specifying criteria for inclusion and acknowledging that reasons for admission might not always be directly related to COVID-19 infection.


Overall, this data suggests a correlation between socioeconomic disadvantage and both hospitalization and intensive care admission for COVID-19 in Wales.  



This text analyzes the trends of COVID-19 hospital admissions and intensive care admissions in Wales from March 1, 2020 to June 26, 2022. 

**Key findings:**

* **Hospital Inpatients:** The highest number of COVID-19 inpatients occurred during Winter 2020/21, reaching approximately 2,000 cases. Later peaks were larger in magnitude, likely due to the Omicron variant's increased transmissibility and widespread hospital screening for asymptomatic cases.
* **Intensive Care Inpatients:** The largest number of COVID-19 intensive care inpatients occurred in April 2020 and January 2021, reaching around 100 patients on a single day. Since November 2021, the number has generally been decreasing.

**Data Sources:**

* PCR test data from the Public Health Wales Datastore database
* Hospital inpatient data from hospital patient administrative systems via ICNET
* Patient and test data linked using NHS numbers


The analysis shows that both hospital admissions and intensive care admissions mirrored the overall trends of COVID-19 infection waves. The Omicron variant significantly impacted hospitalization figures, potentially due to its higher transmissibility and effectiveness in bypassing immunity from previous infections or vaccinations.


The text presents data on COVID-19 hospital inpatients and intensive care unit (ICU) patients in Wales from March 2020 to June 2022.  

**Key findings:**

* **General Trend:** COVID-19 patient numbers have been steadily declining since November 2021, across all waves.
* **Variation by Health Board:**
    * Early peaks (Wave 1) showed higher numbers in areas like Cardiff and Vale, Aneurin Bevan, and Swansea Bay UHBs.
    * Winter 2020/21 saw increased ICU admissions in Cwm Taf Morgannwg, Cardiff and Vale, and Betsi Cadwaladr.
    * Later waves witnessed lower ICU patient numbers compared to earlier periods across all health boards.


The figures are visualized using graphs that illustrate the number of COVID-19 patients admitted daily per health board during each week between these dates. 

While there's a clear decline in hospitalizations since Wave 2, certain health boards had higher admission rates compared to others at different points in time.


The text presents data on COVID-19 hospital inpatients in Wales from March 2020 to June 2022, visualizing the information through several figures.

**Key Findings:**

* **Age Distribution:** Both inpatient (Figures 14 & 15) and intensive care (Figure 16) cases were highest among adults aged 40-79. The youngest and oldest age groups saw significantly fewer cases.
* **Sex Differences:** Figure 17 shows a higher number of male inpatients compared to female inpatients across all waves.
* **Trends Over Time:**  While the text does not explicitly show trends over time, it mentions "all waves" implying that these figures reflect data from different COVID-19 waves and potential variations in hospitalization patterns during those periods.

**Visualization:** The text uses figure numbers (Figures 14-17) to indicate where specific data is presented along with textual descriptions of each figure's content. The visual data itself appears to be heavily stylized with symbols and characters, making it difficult to interpret without seeing the actual figures.

**Missing Information:** 

The text lacks specific details about:

* The time period represented by each "wave" mentioned.
* How the data was collected and analyzed.
* Any statistical significance or confidence intervals associated with the findings.


 **Overall, the text presents a summary of COVID-19 hospitalization data in Wales but requires access to the actual figures for a comprehensive understanding.** 



This text appears to be an excerpt from a legal witness statement related to COVID-19 hospitalizations in Wales. 

**Key Points:**

* **Female COVID-19 Hospitalization Trend:** After the first wave, there has consistently been a slightly higher number of female COVID-19 hospital inpatients than males. However, these differences have remained relatively small throughout the pandemic.
* **Shifting Trends Over Waves:** Initial waves saw a significantly higher number of male COVID-19 inpatients, but this trend reversed later on as hospitalization numbers for both genders declined.
* **Data Limitations:** The available dataset lacks comprehensive information on ethnicity and vulnerabilities of hospitalized patients. Further analysis is needed to explore these aspects. 
* **Population Data by Health Board:**  The statement includes population estimates for different health boards in Wales, highlighting the distribution of the population across regions.
* **Exclusion of Out-of-Wales Admissions:** The data focuses solely on hospitalizations within Wales and excludes admissions of Welsh residents to hospitals outside of Wales.

**Structure:**

The text seems fragmented and possibly copied from a larger document. 

It appears structured as a series of numbered points making observations about COVID-19 hospitalizations in Wales, with references to figures and sources supporting the claims.
