Title: INQ000350691 - Statement by Jane Hutt (Deputy First Minister) and Welsh Government, titled Statement to mark the International Day of Disabled People, dated 01/12/2020.

This statement by Welsh Deputy Minister Jane Hutt marks International Day of Disabled People (December 3rd). It acknowledges the pandemic's disproportionate impact on disabled individuals, highlighting their increased Covid-19 mortality rate linked to socioeconomic factors.

The statement emphasizes the Social Model of Disability, which attributes disability to societal barriers rather than individual impairments. While progress has been made since the Disability Discrimination Act in 1995, Hutt stresses the need for direct action against "disablism" â€“ the actions and systems that disable individuals driven by prejudice, ignorance, or indifference.

Hutt underscores the government's commitment to this approach, including supporting a new fund to assist disabled people in seeking elected office, encouraging their participation in local democracy, and showcasing their crucial role in Wales' economic recovery through initiatives like Disabled People Employment Champions.  


Essentially, the statement aims to highlight the ongoing challenges faced by disabled people and reaffirm the Welsh Government's commitment to fostering a more inclusive and equitable society for them. 



This text discusses the Welsh Government's commitment to supporting disabled people and addressing the unique challenges they face, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Key points include:

* **Creation of Disabled People Employment Champions:** To foster inclusive workplaces across Wales.
* **Launch of "A More Equal Wales" toolkit:** A practical guide for employers on employing disabled people.
* **Active engagement with Disability Equality Forum:**  This forum provides valuable insights and feedback on the impact of the pandemic and informs policy development.
* **Funding allocation to disability projects:** Â£300,000 is provided through Welsh Government reserves and a UK-wide COVID emergency scheme to support disabled people's organisations.
* **Commissioning a report on COVID's impact on disabled people:** Led by Professor Debbie Foster, this study will inform the refresh of the "Action on Disability" framework.

The author expresses gratitude to partners and stakeholders for their contributions and invites fellow Members of the Senedd to celebrate the vital role of disabled people in Wales on International Day of Disabled People.


Overall, the text highlights a proactive approach by the Welsh Government in ensuring inclusion and support for disabled individuals during challenging times.
