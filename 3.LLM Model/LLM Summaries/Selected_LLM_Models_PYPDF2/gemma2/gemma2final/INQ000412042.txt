Title: INQ000412042 - Presentation from UK Covid-19 Inquiry, titled module 2B data and charts, dated between 01/01/2020 and 01/04/2022.

This dataset presents a comprehensive overview of COVID-19 impacts in Wales from April 2020 to February 2024.  

**Key insights:**

* **Mortality:** Daily deaths directly attributed to COVID-19 on death certificates peaked during the first and second waves, gradually decreasing afterward.
* **Excess Deaths:** While direct COVID-19 deaths declined, there were still periods of "excess deaths" (deaths above the five-year average), indicating potential indirect impacts of the pandemic.
* **Hospitalizations:**  Weekly hospital admissions for COVID-19 followed similar trends to death counts, with peaks coinciding with surge waves.
* **Case Numbers:** New daily COVID-19 cases fluctuated significantly throughout the period, mirroring hospitalization and death trends. 
* **Testing Positivity:** The percentage of the population testing positive for COVID-19 also demonstrated waves corresponding to case surges.

**Additional Data Points:**

*  Age-specific mortality rates highlight vulnerable groups impacted by COVID-19.
*  Data on "excess deaths" by location (home, hospital, etc.) reveals potential variations in pandemic impact across settings. 


**Overall, the data paints a picture of fluctuating but generally declining COVID-19 pressures in Wales over time.** However, residual excess deaths suggest continuing ramifications and the need for ongoing monitoring.
