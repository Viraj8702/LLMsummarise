Hi [Name],

I hope this message finds you well. I'm sharing a summary of the text you requested:

The Welsh National COVID-19 Test Plan has been agreed upon by the Minister for Health and Social Services, providing options to expand testing capacity in Wales. Key aspects include:

1. Capital procurement of 4 Starlet and 6 Nimbus platforms (ordered), with delivery timeframes as indicated.
2. Capital procurement of Eplex systems (ordered) with deliveries scheduled for May.
3. Delivery of testing reagents for the current Nimbus platform at University Hospital of Wales (UHW) by March 27th, 2020.
4. Confirmation of 500 daily tests on Roche platform and operational by TBC (before April 30th, 2020).
5. Receipt of the first Starlet at UHW by April 13th, 2020; second and third Starlets at Singleton and Glan Clwyd hospitals by April 30th, 2020.
6. Go live of the Biofire test by April 30th, 2020.
7. Go live of the fourth Starlet at Royal Gwent Hospital and the six Nimbus machines across Wales by May 15th, 2020.
8. Go live of the Eplex systems by May 15th, 2020.

The Minister has questions regarding the testing numbers, which are generated by Public Health Wales (PHW). They want to know how robust the numbers are and if they're based on PHW's generated data or UK initiatives. The plan does not include the extra 5000 tests mentioned last week, as the Roche test failed. However, an extra 1000 tests will be available the following week, followed by a further increase as additional equipment comes online through early May, which will give Wales approximately 3000 daily tests.

The plan does not rely on Boots/Amazon but explores university and other pharma offers for potential capacity expansion. The numbers in the plan are focused on expanding Wales' own capacity without relying on UK initiatives.

Lastly, Cardiff University is working on data linking to improve the situation, and it is positive that we are better off than other UK nations in terms of testing capacity. Wales will share its experience with other nations as part of the fight against COVID-19.

I hope this summary helps. If you have any questions or need further information, please let me know. Best regards.
