Summary: The UK government's strategy to deal with the coronavirus pandemic focuses on three main goals: suppressing the virus, saving lives and protecting the economy. To achieve these goals, they have developed a SAGE (Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies) twin-peak model that involves two peaks of infections with an intervening period of control and suppression. The current plan is to suppress the virus until a vaccine or treatment becomes available. However, some argue that this approach is too slow and advocate for a more aggressive strategy that focuses on immediate containment within households, reducing societal mixing, and signaling a clear end-game. This would involve closing non-essential businesses, limiting household contact, promoting hand-washing and surface cleaning, and setting a defined end-point for the containment period based on specific criteria, such as when new hospital admissions in Wales drop to a certain level. The public should be made aware of what "going vertical" looks like for hospitals, emphasizing their collective role in winning this battle, and signaling that after a short, intense period of containment, traditional methods will be used on a larger scale and with greater speed. While the current strategy may be challenging to implement and not guaranteed to succeed, the alternatives, such as a swamped NHS or 18 months of suppression, are not easy either. The high mutation rate of the virus suggests that future outbreaks will likely require similar actions, including potential mass vaccination programs.
