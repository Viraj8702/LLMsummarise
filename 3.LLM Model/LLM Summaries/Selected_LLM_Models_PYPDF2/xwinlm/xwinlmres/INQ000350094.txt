Summary: In this email conversation, Ysgrifenydd Preifat / Private Secretary Lee Waters AS / MS of the Welsh government's Deputy Minister for Economy and Transport requests an update on previous decisions related to gyms and supermarkets in Tier 4. The sender apologizes for not feeding back vital information to other ministers, particularly regarding unlicensed music events, penalties for businesses, and the potential sale of non-essential items in supermarkets. The sender also explains that private offices like theirs have been made aware of the issue and will ensure such communication oversights do not occur in the future.

Key Points:

1. Decisions related to gyms and supermarkets in Tier 4 were not shared with other ministers, leading to confusion and a lack of coordination.
2. Unlicenced music events: The FM agreed to maintain a £10,000 fixed penalty option for police deterrence, but only after ensuring access to justice was met through clear communication to recipients that they could reject the fine and argue their case in court.
3. Penalties for businesses: A new offence of failure to comply with Premises Improvement Notice terms was created, with LA enforcement officers able to issue £1,000 fines on the first occasion and increasing ones thereafter.
4. Potential sale of non-essential items in supermarkets during Tier 4: The sender is waiting for clarification on any restrictions regarding non-essential item sales.
5. Private offices like the sender's will ensure communication oversights do not occur in the future.


Summary of text:

The COVID-19 restrictions in Wales have been updated, with several changes taking effect this week. The Foreign Office Penalty (FPN) value has been adjusted for violations such as failure to self-isolate following international travel, and the penalties for organizing events with more than 15 people indoors or 30 people outdoors have been increased. The FPN value for international travel operators who fail to provide information to travellers has also been reduced.

Additionally, the First Minister (FM) was not convinced by the argument against creating a new offense for "reckless" breaches of general self-isolation requirements, with a higher FPN value that more closely aligns with the penalty for failure to self-isolate following international travel. The government is currently testing this idea with stakeholders and will provide further advice.

Ministers have also agreed on the recommendation of conducting a systematic review to ensure clarity about the respective roles and responsibilities of different enforcing authorities for each offense. Discussions are also taking place with all enforcing authorities to ensure they understand which offenses are most serious in the COVID context and that the law enforcement response is appropriate to the level of seriousness.

The Chief Government's (CG) final views on penalties for unlicensed music events have been provided, despite initial concerns. He has concluded that while these events generally end up in court, the £1 fine meets the deterrent the police prefer, and the government is satisfied with its legitimate concerns for access to justice. The CG is content with all the proposals in the review relating to penalties for businesses.


The First Minister has reviewed the document and agreed to retain the current restrictions. He has also approved the draft Written Statement at Document 2. In relation to the Review of Fixed Penalty Notices (FPNs) in Document 5, the First Minister does not feel able to agree in principle to the amendments proposed without further discussion. They have requested the following:

1. The view of the Chief Scientific Advisor (CG).
2. Further information on the first proposal related to unlicensed music events. It was mentioned that there was something earlier in the week about a decision not to invoke any further penalties of this sort in England until the issue of court-level penalties being awarded is addressed. The First Minister has reserved his decision on this matter and will consider the information provided when making a final decision.

The document also mentions that other comments received during the review were from the Minister for Housing and Local Government, who was happy with the proportionate recommendations made; and the Deputy Minister and Chief Whip, who supported maintaining the £10,000 FPN for unlicensed music events but agreed with the case against removing it.

Lastly, the document emphasizes that the change in penalties would bring more coherence to the penalty scales, as there will be limited cases where the scale starts at £500, apart from offences committed by businesses and the music event offense. This is seen as a reasonable deterrent for house parties, which have continued despite the high risk of spread and current high incidence rates among under-25s. Comms advisors believe that this measure would be best suited with the planned messages for the following week, which could potentially convey the dangerousness of organizing such events effectively to the public.

The FM will consider these points and provide his views on the matter before incorporating the amendments into the regulations, which will come into effect next Friday, along with the covering Ministerial Announcement (MA) as necessary.


Summary of the text:

1. In England, the issue of court level penalties for breaching COVID-19 regulations has arisen as a concern, and it is unclear whether police forces in Wales would enforce such penalties if they arose. The First Minister would like to know how Police Scotland currently deals with these issues before making a decision on the matter.
2. The remaining proposals for the review of fixed penalty notices (FPNs) are less contentious, but the First Minister would prefer to gather feedback from ministerial colleagues before moving forward.
3. The First Minister requests that private offices confirm whether ministers have had a chance to review the draft review of FPNs at doc 5 and provide any comments as soon as possible. The First Minister hopes to make a final decision on Monday.
4. A statement from the Chief Medical Officer is expected shortly, and a Welsh translation of the draft Written Statement will be provided the following day.
5. The document originates from the COVID-19 - Project Team at the Welsh Government.
