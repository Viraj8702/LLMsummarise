Title: INQ000385719 - Email chain between Rob Orford (Chief Scientific Adviser for Health, Welsh Government), Frank Atherton (Chief Medical Officer for Wales), Tracey Cooper (Chief Executive of Public Health Wales) and colleagues, regarding PHW/WG - National assessment, dated between 10/11/2020 and 11/10/2020.

The text provided is a summary of an email sent by Rob to Huw, Giri, and Tracey, discussing the strategic approach to addressing the COVID-19 pandemic in Wales. The email outlines key points that could help focus the discussion ahead of a meeting scheduled for 2 pm.

The main points are as follows:

1. Strategic intent: The author suggests two options for the strategy - suppression followed by ambition for elimination or suppression to an acceptable baseline of endemicity until a vaccine or treatment becomes available. Discussion about the potential collateral damage and the level of acceptable endemicity should also be addressed.
2. Current situation: The email highlights that case incidence will continue to rise, hospital admissions will increase, and deaths will go up. Additionally, there will be outbreaks in healthcare settings, care homes, and universities, which will contribute to the new case burden.
3. Global experience: The author mentions three key factors for successful suppression followed by elimination attempts: very stringent border control, a highly functional test, trace, and isolate programme, and clear messaging to communities.
4. Options and timing: The email suggests that if the current approach (local and hyper-local lockdowns) becomes ineffective, additional national interventions should be considered and enacted when necessary. It also discusses long-term measures that need to be put in place.
5. No obligation to join the meeting: Huw, Giri, and Tracey are encouraged to prepare a summary based on Rob's email in advance of the scheduled meeting.

In conclusion, the author emphasizes the importance of discussing the strategy for Wales during the next meeting, considering the current situation and potential future developments related to COVID-19.
