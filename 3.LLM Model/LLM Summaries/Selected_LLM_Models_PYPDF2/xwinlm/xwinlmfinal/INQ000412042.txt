The summary of the text provided is as follows:

In Wales, daily deaths with COVID-19 on the death certificate have increased over time since April 2020, reaching a peak in January 2022. The five-year average of excess weekly deaths was also higher during this period, indicating an overall increase in mortality rates.

In May 2020, daily deaths with COVID-19 on the death certificate were around 600, and by January 2022, they had reached about 1,400. Excess weekly deaths increased significantly, reaching a high of approximately 3,187 in September 2020 and January 2021, with the five-year average percentage of the population testing positive for COVID-19 remaining relatively stable at around 6%.

Wave I (April 15, 2020) and Wave II (July 2020) deaths are both attributed to COVID-19. Excess deaths were higher during Wave II (32%), while the percentage of the population testing positive for COVID-19 was lower around 2%. In Wave I, daily deaths with COVID-19 on the death certificate were in the range of 400 to 600.

During the second wave (Wave II), daily deaths with COVID-19 on the death certificate reached a peak of approximately 2,109 in January 2021 and excess deaths reached over 3,000. The five-year average percentage of the population testing positive for COVID-19 was in the range of 5% to 8%.

As of April 2, 2022, new cases of COVID-19 per day by specimen date in Wales were around 150, indicating a decrease from previously reported figures. The estimated percentage of the population testing positive for COVID-19 was approximately 10% in May 2020 and reached 20% in September 2020 before decreasing to around 6% in December 2021.

Age-specific death rates involving COVID-19 by five-year age group in March 2020 to June 2022 showed a general increasing trend, particularly among older age groups. Excess deaths by place of occurrence from March 2020 to June 2022 also indicated higher mortality rates, with a significant proportion due to home and hospice deaths.

Weekly mortality rates compared to the 2015-2019 average were highest in February 2021 at around 8%; however, this figure has since decreased to about 2% as of May 2022. Cumulative mortality for 2020-2022 compared to the 2015-2019 average showed a slight increase.

In conclusion, daily deaths with COVID-19 on the death certificate in Wales have increased over time since April 2020, reaching a peak in January 2022, while excess weekly deaths reached highs during Wave II. Age-specific death rates involving COVID-19 show an increasing trend among older age groups. Excess deaths and mortality rates have shown a general decreasing trend since February 2021, but remain higher than pre-pandemic levels.
