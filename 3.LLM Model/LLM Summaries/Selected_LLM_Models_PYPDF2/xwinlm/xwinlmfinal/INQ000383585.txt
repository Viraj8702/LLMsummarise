Here is a summary of the text provided:

On Friday, January 31st at 09:00, the UK Chief Medical Officer (CMO) held a briefing call for Directors of Public Health (DsPH). The briefing focused on the current epidemiology of the coronavirus outbreak and discussed two potential scenarios with the possibility of shifting from containment to mitigation measures. However, as of now, they are using pandemic flu models for reasonable worst-case scenario planning.

During the Q&A session:

* The CMO confirmed that surviving infection does not guarantee protection against re-infection.
* NERVTAG will issue advice on treatment options, and current consideration of various treatment options is underway.
* The CMO agrees that planning for mitigation now is wise.
* The CMO updated the callers on the plane bringing people back from China and changes to geographical and clinical case definitions.

B.et.wishes, Head of Office to the Chief Medical Officer at the Department of Health & Social Care, then provided an outline of the call's topics and participants, emphasizing that this email would not be saved by the CMO Private Office and should be kept for audit purposes if necessary.

The summary highlights the ongoing discussion about potential scenarios related to the coronavirus outbreak, with a focus on containment vs. mitigation measures, survivability after infection, and treatment options. Planning for mitigation is deemed wise, and updates on case definitions have been communicated during the call.
