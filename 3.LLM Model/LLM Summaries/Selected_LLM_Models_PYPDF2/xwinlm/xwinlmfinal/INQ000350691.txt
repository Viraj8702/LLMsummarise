Title: INQ000350691 - Statement by Jane Hutt (Deputy First Minister) and Welsh Government, titled Statement to mark the International Day of Disabled People, dated 01/12/2020.

In response to the International Day of Disabled People, the Welsh Government released a statement emphasizing the importance of building a more inclusive and accessible world post-COVID. The statement highlights how the pandemic has exacerbated existing issues faced by disabled people, such as isolation, disconnect, and socioeconomic factors. Despite recent progress, the latest data from ONS indicates that 68% of COVID-related deaths in Wales during March to July were from disabled communities, with people with learning disabilities being more likely to die from the virus.

The Welsh Government acknowledges the Social Model of Disability, which posits that society is responsible for disabling individuals rather than their impairments. To address this issue, they aim to incorporate a disability-inclusive approach in all policies and decisions made across the Senedd. This includes identifying and removing barriers to disabled people's contributions and creating an environment where they can thrive.

To support disabled individuals seeking elected office in the upcoming 2021 Senedd and 2022 Local Government elections, the Welsh Government is providing a fund that will help cover costs associated with running for office, such as campaign materials, training, and childcare support. This measure is intended to reduce barriers and encourage more disabled people to participate in local democracy and represent their communities.

Finally, the statement mentions the role of disabled individuals in the economic recovery, with plans to appoint Disabled People Employment Champions, who will work alongside employers to create more inclusive workplaces and increase opportunities for disabled job seekers. By taking these steps, Wales aims to build back better and develop a disability-inclusive, accessible, and sustainable post-COVID world.


This speech focuses on the importance of supporting disabled people in the workforce and ensuring equal opportunities for all. The Welsh government has introduced a toolkit called 'A More Equal Wales: A Practical Guide for Employers Employing Disabled People,' which will be launched to coincide with the International Day of Disabled People. The speech also discusses the efforts made by the Welsh government to understand the impact of the pandemic on disabled people and their organizations through the Disability Equality Forum and the Accessible Communication Group.

The Welsh government has allocated £200,000 from its Reserves for Reconstruction package to fund disability projects across Wales, complementing the UK-wide COVID emergency scheme's £100,000 allocation. These funds will be distributed as small grants to nine Disabled People's Organisations in Wales to support vital work, provide information and advice, and develop new ways to respond to the Covid-19 needs of disabled people.

Professor Debbie Foster from Cardiff University has agreed to lead a project to produce a report on the impact of COVID on disabled people. The Disability Equality Forum members will work alongside Professor Foster to bring together information, evidence, and case studies. The intention is to use this important report to inform a refresh of the "Action on Disability" framework launched in 2019. By revisiting the framework in light of COVID, the Welsh government aims to be able to act quickly to embed the learning from this pandemic and create a more inclusive environment for disabled people in the workforce.

Lastly, the speaker invites all Senedd Members to celebrate the contribution of disabled people in Wales on the International Day of Disabled People and reaffirms their commitment to supporting equal opportunities for all.
