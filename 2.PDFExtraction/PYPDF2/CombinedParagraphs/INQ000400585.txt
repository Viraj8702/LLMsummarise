I, Christopher Williams care of Public Health Wales, 2 Capital Quarter, Tyndall Street, Cardiff, 
CF10 4BZ will say as follows: - 
1. This corporate witness statement is provided by me in my capacity as Consultant 
Epidemiologist at Public Health Wales in response to a request for evidence made by 
the Inquiry Team to Public Health Wales for the disclosure of hospital admission and 
hospital inpatient data covering the period 1 February 2020 to 28 June 2022. 
3. A COVID-19 case is defined (by Public Health Wales) as a person with a positive 
SARS-CoV-2 PCR test taken in Wales. COVID-19 cases admitted to hospital are those 
admitted to a hospital in Wales for at least one night within 28 days after a positive 
SARS-CoV-2 PCR test taken in Wales, or where the patient tested positive in hospital 
up to 2 days after admission (where the day of admission is counted as day 1 of an 
inpatient stay). All admissions within 28 days after a positive test are counted, 
regardless of whether the patient tested positive in the community or during a previous 
inpatient stay. For data up to 25 May 2022, one positive test per person within a 42 
day period was counted as a case. From 26 May 2022, the de-duplication period 
increased to 90 days. The hospital admissions may have been unrelated to the 
patients' SARS-CoV-2 positive test. An evaluation of COVID-19 admissions estimated

4. COVID-19 cases admitted to intensive care are those admitted to an intensive care 
5. PCR test data was extracted from the Public Health Wales Datastore database. 
Hospital admissions data was extracted from the hospital patient administrative system 
(PAS) via ICNET. Patient and test data has been linked using the patient NHS number. 
6. Residential address used for assignment to deprivation quintile has been extracted 
from a live system and may not be the address of the case at the time of their SARS-
CoV-2 test. 
7. Resident population sizes of health boards in Wales have been provided in the 
Appendix to support interpretation of counts by health board. Other breakdowns of the

8. The first recorded COVID-19 case in Wales was confirmed on 27 February 2020 and 
have therefore provided data to the nearest Sunday to the request date - 26 June 2022 
rather than 28 June 2022.

9. Over approximately 16 months, there were nearly 24,000 COVID-19 case admissions 
to hospitals in Wales. Cwm Taf Morgannwg UHB had the highest number of case 
admissions to its hospitals, comprising 21% of total cases admitted. Aneurin Bevan, 
Betsi Cadwaladr and Cardiff and Vale University Health Boards (UHB) had similar 
numbers of admissions to their hospitals, comprising between 18 and 20% of total case 
admissions. Lower numbers of cases were admitted to hospitals in Swansea Bay and 
Hywel Dda UHBs, comprising 13% and 9% of total cases admitted respectively. 
10. Approximately 2,000 COVID-19 cases were admitted to intensive care in a hospital in 
Wales. Cwm Taf Morgannwg UHB had the highest number of cases admitted to its 
intensive care units, comprising 22% of total intensive care admissions. 
11. The number of cases admitted to the hospitals and the intensive care units in a health 
board will be impacted by the size of the population in the catchment area, the 
incidence of COVID-19 within that population and the bed capacity of the hospitals and 
intensive care units.

12. Case admissions have varied considerably over the 16 month period, with an initial 
peak at the end of March 2020, a second peak in late December 2020/early January 
2021 and then a series of smaller peaks from Autumn 2021 onwards. 
13. Variations in the numbers of case admissions to hospital are influenced by changes in 
the underlying incidence of COVID-19 overtime, the availability of testing, the severity 
of disease associated with different variants, the roll-out of the vaccination campaign 
and improvements in community management of the disease. 
14. The notch in the chart in autumn 2020 was almost certainly caused by the "fire-break" 
intervention from 23 October 2020 to 9 November 2020 (National coronavirus firebreak 
to be introduced in Wales on Friday I GOV.WALES).

15. Peaks in intensive care admissions reflect the timing of the peaks in COVID-19 case 
hospital admissions. However, the height of the peaks in intensive care admissions 
reduced with every wave, reflecting improved patient treatments and management and 
widespread vaccine roll out, resulting in better patient outcomes and reduced 
requirement for intensive care support.

16. Whilst there were some small differences in the timing of the peaks in case admissions 
by health board, broadly, all health boards experienced peaks at the same time. Case 
admissions to Hywel Dda UHB were consistently lower over all waves. Cwm Taf 
Morgannwg UHB had the highest number of case admissions to its hospitals in wave 
2 and early in Autumn 2021, but subsequently higher case admissions were observed 
in Betsi Cadwaladr UHB. There were larger differences in health board case 
admissions in wave 2, compared to the subsequent waves.

17. Small numbers of weekly intensive case admissions make data difficult to interpret, 
particularly after the first two waves. Betsi Cadwaladr and particularly Hywel Dda UHBs 
had comparatively fewer admissions to their intensive care units in the first wave than 
the other major health boards. Within wave 2, admissions to intensive care in Cwm Taf 
Morgannwg UHB were consistently higher than to those in other health boards from 
September to December 2021, followed by Betsi Cadwaladr UHB peaking in January.

18. Within the 20 year age categories, the highest number of cases admitted to hospital 
was in those aged 60-79 years, comprising more than a third of all admitted cases.

IN Q000400585_0007 
 The fewest case admissions were in the 0-19 age group, comprising 6% of total cases 
admitted to hospital. The highest number of cases admitted to intensive care was also 
in the 60-79 age group, comprising 45% of total intensive care admissions. The highest 
proportion of admissions admitted to intensive care was in the 40-59 age group, at 
17% of case admissions in that age group. Three percent of cases admitted to 
intensive care were in the 80+ age group. 
19. In addition to the influences mentioned in earlier sections, the distribution of hospital 
and intensive care admissions by age group will also be influenced by the age 
distribution of the underlying population. For intensive care admissions, reduced 
numbers of cases admitted in the oldest age groups may not indicate less severe 
disease in this group, but a reduced ability to benefit from intensive care support. This 
is due in turn to the overall more severe outcome profile in older age groups mediated 
partly by age and partly by co-morbidities and other factors associated with increasing 
age.

20. In general, over time, cases admitted were consistently highest in the 60-79 age group. 
In the older age groups, cases admitted decreased with each subsequent wave after 
wave 2. In contrast, cases admitted from the two younger age groups broadly 
increased over time, with higher numbers in each subsequent wave. This is likely to 
be due to a combination of changes in immunity through vaccination and infection, 
changes in the virus and its epidemiology.

than female. The difference between the sexes was particularly noticeable in the first

wave in Autumn 2021 was as a result of a reduction of male cases admitted to intensive 
care in Wales.

25. The Welsh Index of Multiple Deprivation (WIMD) is the Welsh Government's official 
measure of relative deprivation for small areas in Wales. It identifies areas with the 
12 
IN Q000400585_0012 
 highest concentrations of several different types of deprivation. WIMD ranks all small 
areas in Wales from 1 (most deprived) to 1,909 (least deprived). It is a National Statistic 
produced by statisticians at the Welsh Government (Index of Multiple Deprivation 
(gov.wales)). Seventy-nine per cent of the cases admitted to hospital and 78% of cases 
admitted to intensive care could be assigned to a deprivation quintile. Amongst those 
that could be assigned, numbers of case admissions increased as deprivation 
increased with 26% of case admissions residing in the most deprived quintile 
compared to 15% residing in the least deprived quintile. A similar pattern was observed 
in intensive care case admissions, although the difference in percentage points 
between the highest and lowest quintile was larger, with 27% of intensive care case 
admissions residing in the most deprived quintile compared to 13% in the least 
deprived quintile. 
26. Within each deprivation quintile, a similar percentage of case admissions to hospital 
were admitted to intensive care, but the highest percentage was observed in the most 
deprived quintile at 8.7% and the lowest percentage in the least deprived quintile at 
7.6%. 
27. In Wales, a COVID-19 hospital inpatient is defined as a person in a hospital in Wales 
on a Sunday who has spent at least one night in hospital and has had a positive SARS-
CoV-2 PCR test taken in Wales in the previous 28 days. The reasons for the inpatient 
stays may be unrelated to the patients' positive SARS-CoV-2 test. Cases may include 
patients who have acquired their infection in the hospital. This count refers to a 'point 
prevalence' survey of inpatients i.e. only capturing those actually in beds on that day. 
People may be admitted and discharged between these points (these would be 
captured in the admissions data) but overall, the picture on any given day (e.g. Sunday) 
reflects what is likely to be present through the rest of the week, subject to weekly 
rhythms around admission and discharges. 
28. A COVID-19 intensive care inpatient is defined as a person in an intensive care unit in 
a hospital in Wales on a Sunday who has spent at least one night in intensive care and 
has had a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test taken in Wales in the previous 28 days. The 
reasons for the intensive care stays may be unrelated to the patients' positive SARS-
CoV-2 test. The data does not include inpatients in high dependency units.

 29. PCR test data was extracted from the Public Health Wales Datastore database. 
Hospital inpatient data was extracted from the hospital patient administrative system 
(PAS) via ICNET. Patient and test data has been linked using the patient NHS number. 
therefore all data is presented from 1 March 2020. Continuous data on admissions is 
stored as aggregate weekly counts with weeks running from Monday to Sunday. We 
have therefore provided data to the nearest Sunday to the request date — 26 June 
2022 rather than 28 June 2022.

31. The COVID-19 inpatient trends are very similar to those for the COVID-19 case 
admissions in terms of timing. The highest number of COVID-19 inpatients was in 
Winter 2020/21, with approximately 2,000 inpatient cases. The later peaks in inpatients 
from Autumn 2021 onwards increased in magnitude with each wave. This likely 
reflected increased incidence in the community as a result of the Omicron variant, but 
also may reflect high levels of screening in hospitals for early identification of 
asymptomatic cases, and increased transmissibility of Omicron in hospital settings.

32. Trends in intensive care COVID-19 inpatients followed general COVID-19 inpatient 
numbers in terms of timing. The largest number of COVID-19 intensive care inpatients 
was in April 2020 and January 2021 at approximately 100 intensive care inpatient 
cases on a single day. There was a large decrease in intensive care COVID-19 
inpatients between Wave 2 and subsequent waves and numbers have generally been 
on a decreasing trend since November 2021.

33. There were some small differences between health boards in the timing of the peaks. 
The highest number of COVID-19 inpatients was in Cwm Taf Morgannwg UHB in 
Winter 2020/21, with more than 500 patients in the hospitals within that health board 
in a single week and approximately double the number than was in Hywel Dda UHB at 
the same time. In later waves, COVID-19 inpatient numbers were relatively similar 
between the larger health boards, with the exception of Betsi Cadwaladr UHB in 
January and April 2022 where there were considerably higher numbers of COVID-19 
inpatients.

cases were consistently highest in the 80+ age group. In one week in January 2021, 
there were approximately 900 COVID-19 inpatients aged 80 years or older in Welsh 
hospitals. The peaks in inpatients in all waves were largely composed of inpatients in 
the two oldest age groups (60-79 and 80+), which may reflect the likely longer lengths 
of stay of more elderly patients and screening of these patients within hospital. There 
was a small increase in inpatients in the youngest age group over time.

38. Over the first two waves there were markedly more male COVID-19 hospital inpatients 
than female. In the later waves numbers of both male and female COVID-19 inpatients 
reduced and the difference between them decreased. 
39. Data available does not enable analysis by other protected characteristics, as ethnicity 
data is very poorly completed (<40%) and vulnerabilities are also not included in the 
dataset. A breakdown by index of multiple deprivation is possible but would require a 
large amount of new analysis, as the dataset is a series of point prevalence data on 
current inpatients each Sunday — this would need to be aggregated and then linked to 
the deprivation by postcode.
