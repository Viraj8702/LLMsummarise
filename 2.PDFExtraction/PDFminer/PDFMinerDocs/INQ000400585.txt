I,  Christopher Williams care of  Public Health Wales, 2 Capital Quarter, Tyndall Street, Cardiff, 

CF10 4BZ will say as follows: - 

1.  This  corporate  witness  statement  is  provided  by  me  in  my  capacity  as  Consultant 

Epidemiologist at Public Health Wales in  response to a  request for evidence made by 

the Inquiry Team  to  Public  Health  Wales for the disclosure of  hospital admission  and 

hospital  inpatient data covering the period 1  February 2020 to 28 June 2022. 

3.  A  COVID-19  case  is  defined  (by  Public  Health  Wales)  as  a  person  with  a  positive 

SARS-CoV-2 PCR test taken in Wales. COVID-19 cases admitted to hospital are those 

admitted  to  a  hospital  in  Wales for at  least  one  night within  28 days after a  positive 

SARS-CoV-2 PCR test taken  in Wales, or where the patient tested  positive in  hospital 

up to 2 days after admission  (where the day of  admission  is  counted  as day 1  of  an 

inpatient  stay).  All  admissions  within  28  days  after  a  positive  test  are  counted, 

regardless of whether the patient tested  positive in the community or during a previous 

inpatient stay.  For data  up to 25 May 2022,  one  positive test  per  person within  a  42 

day  period  was  counted  as  a  case.  From  26  May  2022,  the  de-duplication  period 

increased  to  90  days.  The  hospital  admissions  may  have  been  unrelated  to  the 

patients' SARS-CoV-2 positive test.  An evaluation of COVID-19 admissions estimated

4.  COVID-19 cases admitted  to  intensive  care are those  admitted  to  an  intensive  care 

5.  PCR  test  data  was  extracted  from  the  Public  Health  Wales  Datastore  database. 

Hospital admissions data was extracted from the hospital patient administrative system 

(PAS) via  ICNET. Patient and test data has been linked  using the patient NHS number. 

6.  Residential  address  used  for  assignment  to  deprivation  quintile  has  been  extracted 

from a live system and  may not be the address of the case at the time of  their SARS-

CoV-2 test. 

7.  Resident  population  sizes  of  health  boards  in  Wales  have  been  provided  in  the 

Appendix to support interpretation of counts by health  board. Other breakdowns of the

8.  The first  recorded  COVID-19 case in  Wales was confirmed  on 27 February 2020 and 

have therefore provided data to the nearest Sunday to the request date - 26 June 2022 

rather than 28 June 2022.

9.  Over approximately 16 months, there were nearly 24,000 COVID-19 case admissions 

to hospitals  in  Wales.  Cwm  Taf Morgannwg  UHB  had  the  highest  number  of  case 

admissions to its hospitals, comprising 21%  of total cases admitted.  Aneurin Bevan, 

Betsi  Cadwaladr  and  Cardiff  and  Vale  University  Health  Boards  (UHB) had  similar 

numbers of admissions to their hospitals, comprising between 18 and 20% of total case 

admissions. Lower numbers of cases were admitted to hospitals in Swansea Bay and 

Hywel Dda UHBs, comprising 13% and 9% of total cases admitted respectively. 

10. Approximately 2,000 COVID-19 cases were admitted to intensive care in a hospital in 

Wales.  Cwm  Taf Morgannwg UHB  had  the highest number of cases admitted to its 

intensive care units, comprising 22% of total intensive care admissions. 

11. The number of cases admitted to the hospitals and the intensive care units in a health 

board  will  be  impacted  by  the  size  of  the  population  in  the  catchment  area,  the 

incidence of COVID-19 within that population and the bed capacity of the hospitals and 

intensive care units.

12. Case admissions have  varied  considerably over the 16  month period, with  an initial 

peak at the end of March 2020, a  second peak in late December 2020/early January 

2021 and then a series of smaller peaks from Autumn 2021 onwards. 

13. Variations in the numbers of case admissions to hospital are influenced by changes in 

the underlying incidence of COVID-19 overtime, the availability of testing, the severity 

of disease associated with different variants, the roll-out of the vaccination campaign 

and improvements in community management of the disease. 

14. The notch in the chart in autumn 2020 was almost certainly caused by the "fire-break" 

intervention from 23 October 2020 to 9 November 2020 (National coronavirus firebreak 

to be introduced in Wales on Friday I GOV.WALES).

15. Peaks in intensive care admissions reflect the timing of the peaks in COVID-19 case 

hospital admissions. However,  the height of the peaks  in  intensive care  admissions 

reduced with every wave, reflecting improved patient treatments and management and 

widespread  vaccine  roll  out,  resulting  in  better  patient  outcomes  and  reduced 

requirement for intensive care support.

16. Whilst there were some small differences in the timing of the peaks in case admissions 

by health board, broadly, all health boards experienced peaks at the same time. Case 

admissions  to  Hywel  Dda  UHB  were  consistently  lower  over  all  waves.  Cwm  Taf 

Morgannwg UHB had the highest number of case admissions to its hospitals in wave 

2 and early in Autumn 2021, but subsequently higher case admissions were observed 

in  Betsi  Cadwaladr  UHB.  There  were  larger  differences  in  health  board  case 

admissions in wave 2, compared to the subsequent waves.

17. Small numbers of weekly  intensive case  admissions  make  data  difficult  to  interpret, 

particularly after the first two waves. Betsi Cadwaladr and particularly Hywel Dda UHBs 

had comparatively fewer admissions to their intensive care units in the first wave than 

the other major health boards. Within wave 2, admissions to intensive care in Cwm Taf 

Morgannwg UHB were consistently higher than to those in  other health boards from 

September to December 2021, followed by Betsi Cadwaladr UHB peaking in January.

18. Within the 20 year age categories, the highest number of cases admitted to hospital 

was  in those aged 60-79 years, comprising more  than  a  third of all  admitted  cases.

The fewest case admissions were in the 0-19 age group, comprising 6% of total cases 

admitted to hospital. The highest number of cases admitted to intensive care was also 

in the 60-79 age group, comprising 45% of total intensive care admissions. The highest 

proportion of admissions admitted to intensive care was in the 40-59 age group, at 

17%  of  case  admissions  in  that  age  group.  Three  percent  of  cases  admitted  to 

intensive care were in the 80+ age group. 

19. In addition to the influences mentioned in earlier sections, the distribution of hospital 

and  intensive  care  admissions  by  age  group  will  also  be  influenced  by  the  age 

distribution  of  the  underlying  population.  For  intensive  care  admissions,  reduced 

numbers  of cases admitted in the oldest age  groups may not indicate less  severe 

disease in this group, but a reduced ability to benefit from intensive care support. This 

is  due in turn to the overall more severe outcome profile in older age groups mediated 

partly by age and partly by co-morbidities and other factors associated with increasing 

age.

20. In general, over time, cases admitted were consistently highest in the 60-79 age group. 

In the older age groups, cases admitted decreased with each subsequent wave after 

wave  2.  In  contrast,  cases  admitted  from  the  two  younger  age  groups  broadly 

increased over time, with higher numbers in each subsequent wave. This  is likely to 

be  due to a  combination  of changes  in  immunity  through  vaccination  and  infection, 

changes in the virus and its epidemiology.

21. In each wave, numbers of case admissions to intensive care were highest in the 40-

59 and 60-79 age groups. There were substantial reductions in the numbers of cases 

admitted to intensive care in these two age groups following the second wave.

Female  —  Male 

23. In general, over the first two waves, there were consistently more male cases admitted 

to hospital than female. However, particularly from the beginning of 2022 there were 

more female cases admitted than male.

Female  —  Male 

24. Over time, there have consistently been more male cases admitted to intensive care 

than female. The difference between the sexes was particularly noticeable in the first 

two waves. Most of the reduction of cases admitted to intensive care observed in the 

wave in Autumn 2021 was as a result of a reduction of male cases admitted to intensive 

care in Wales.

25. The Welsh Index of Multiple Deprivation (WIMD) is  the Welsh Government's official 

measure of relative  deprivation for small  areas in Wales. It identifies areas with  the 

12 

IN Q000400585_0012 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
highest concentrations of  several  different types of  deprivation. WIMD  ranks all  small 

areas in Wales from 1 (most deprived) to 1,909 (least deprived). It  is a National Statistic 

produced  by  statisticians  at  the  Welsh  Government  (Index  of  Multiple  Deprivation 

(gov.wales)). Seventy-nine per cent of the cases admitted to hospital and 78% of cases 

admitted to intensive care could  be assigned to a deprivation  quintile. Amongst those 

that  could  be  assigned,  numbers  of  case  admissions  increased  as  deprivation 

increased  with  26%  of  case  admissions  residing  in  the  most  deprived  quintile 

compared to 15% residing in the least deprived quintile. A similar pattern was observed 

in  intensive  care  case  admissions,  although  the  difference  in  percentage  points 

between  the  highest  and  lowest  quintile was larger,  with  27%  of  intensive  care case 

admissions  residing  in  the  most  deprived  quintile  compared  to  13%  in  the  least 

deprived quintile. 

26. Within  each  deprivation  quintile,  a  similar  percentage of  case admissions to  hospital 

were admitted to intensive care, but the highest percentage was observed in  the most 

deprived  quintile  at 8.7% and  the  lowest  percentage  in  the  least deprived  quintile  at 

7.6%. 

27. In  Wales, a COVID-19 hospital  inpatient is defined as a  person  in  a  hospital  in  Wales 

on a Sunday who has spent at least one night in  hospital and has had a positive SARS-

CoV-2  PCR test taken in  Wales in  the previous 28 days. The reasons for the inpatient 

stays may be unrelated to the patients' positive SARS-CoV-2 test. Cases may include 

patients who have acquired their infection  in  the hospital. This count  refers to a  'point 

prevalence' survey of  inpatients i.e. only capturing those actually in  beds on  that day. 

People  may  be  admitted  and  discharged  between  these  points  (these  would  be 

captured in the admissions data) but overall, the picture on any given day (e.g. Sunday) 

reflects what  is  likely  to  be  present  through  the  rest  of  the week,  subject  to  weekly 

rhythms around admission  and discharges. 

28. A COVID-19 intensive care inpatient is defined as a person  in  an intensive care unit in 

a hospital in Wales on a Sunday who has spent at least one night in  intensive care and 

has had a positive SARS-CoV-2  PCR test taken in Wales in  the previous 28 days. The 

reasons for the intensive care stays may be unrelated to the patients' positive SARS-

CoV-2 test. The data does not include inpatients in  high  dependency units.

I NQ000400585_0013 

29. PCR  test  data  was  extracted  from  the  Public  Health  Wales  Datastore  database. 

Hospital  inpatient  data was extracted from  the  hospital  patient administrative system 

(PAS) via  ICNET. Patient and test data has been linked  using the patient NHS number. 

therefore all  data  is  presented from  1  March  2020. Continuous data on  admissions is 

stored as aggregate weekly counts with  weeks running from  Monday to Sunday.  We 

have  therefore  provided  data  to  the  nearest  Sunday to  the  request  date  —  26  June 

2022  rather than 28 June 2022.

31. The  COVID-19  inpatient  trends  are  very  similar  to  those  for  the  COVID-19  case 

admissions  in  terms  of  timing.  The highest  number  of COVID-19  inpatients  was  in 

Winter 2020/21, with approximately 2,000 inpatient cases. The later peaks in inpatients 

from  Autumn  2021  onwards  increased  in  magnitude  with  each  wave.  This  likely 

reflected increased incidence in the community as a result of the Omicron variant, but 

also  may  reflect  high  levels  of  screening  in  hospitals  for  early  identification  of 

asymptomatic cases, and increased transmissibility of Omicron in hospital settings.

32. Trends  in  intensive  care  COVID-19  inpatients  followed  general  COVID-19  inpatient 

numbers in terms of timing. The largest number of COVID-19 intensive care inpatients 

was  in  April  2020  and  January  2021 at  approximately  100  intensive  care  inpatient 

cases  on  a  single  day.  There  was  a  large  decrease  in  intensive  care  COVID-19 

inpatients between Wave 2 and subsequent waves and numbers have generally been 

on a decreasing trend since November 2021.

33. There were some small differences between health boards in the timing of the peaks. 

The  highest  number  of COVID-19  inpatients  was  in  Cwm  Taf  Morgannwg  UHB  in 

Winter 2020/21, with more than 500 patients in the hospitals within that health board 

in a single week and approximately double the number than was in Hywel Dda UHB at 

the  same  time.  In  later  waves,  COVID-19 inpatient  numbers  were  relatively  similar 

between  the  larger  health  boards,  with  the  exception  of  Betsi  Cadwaladr  UHB  in 

January and April 2022 where there were considerably higher numbers of COVID-19 

inpatients.

34. In  the  first  wave,  highest  numbers  of  COVID-19  intensive  care  inpatients  were  in 

Cardiff  and  Vale,  Aneurin  Bevan  and  Swansea  Bay  UHBs,  with  approximately  25 

patients each in a single week. Similar peaks in counts were experienced in Cwm Taf 

Morgannwg, Cardiff and Vale and Betsi Cadwaladr UHBs in Winter 2020/21. Numbers 

of intensive  care inpatient  cases  were much lower  in all health boards in  the peaks 

following wave 2.

35. Whilst  cases  admitted  were  consistently  highest  in  the  60-79  age  group,  inpatient 

cases were consistently highest in the 80+ age group. In one week in January 2021, 

there were approximately 900 COVID-19 inpatients aged 80 years or older in Welsh 

hospitals. The peaks in inpatients in all waves were largely composed of inpatients in 

the two oldest age groups (60-79 and 80+), which may reflect the likely longer lengths 

of stay of more elderly patients and screening of these patients within hospital. There 

was a small increase in inpatients in the youngest age group over time.

37. Trends over time by sex have been very similar. In general, after the first wave there 

have been consistently more female COVID-1 9 hospital inpatients that male. However, 

these differences have been small.

38. Over the first two waves there were markedly more male COVID-19 hospital inpatients 

than female. In the later waves numbers of both male and female COVID-19 inpatients 

reduced and the difference between them decreased. 

39. Data available does not enable analysis by other protected characteristics, as ethnicity 

data is  very poorly completed (<40%) and vulnerabilities are also not included in the 

dataset. A breakdown by index of multiple deprivation is possible but would require a 

large amount of new analysis, as the dataset is a  series of point prevalence data on 

current inpatients each Sunday —  this would need to be aggregated and then linked to 

the deprivation by postcode.
