Technical Advisory Group 

Statement regarding NPIs in the pre-Christmas period 

21 December 2020 

The purpose of this paper is to set out the technical and scientific rationale for the introduction 

of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) in Wales in the pre-Christmas period. 

Take home messages 

•  The virus spreads when an infected individual comes into contact with an 

uninfected individual(s). The likelihood of a contact between an infected individual 

and an uninfected individual resulting in a transmission is dependent upon the 

nature of the contact. Some environments and behaviours are more likely to 

enable the virus to transmit. 

•  Social distancing and quarantining remains highly effective at reducing the risk of 

infecting others, if observed correctly. Pre-isolating (e.g. not mixing outside of the 

household) for one incubation period (10 days) would be an effective way of 

lowering your risk of infecting others. Self-isolation remains of paramount 

importance for anyone with COVID-1 9 symptoms. 

•  The best way to protect older family members is not to expose them to potential 

infection, no matter how well-intended the reason for contact. 

•  Survey data suggests evidence of household-mixing with those outside of the 

extended household. This is accompanied by a misunderstanding of the risks of 

transmission associated with mixing.  Evidence suggests that increased mixing of 

households and individuals in indoor settings poses a substantial risk of 

transmission. Therefore, the fewer households and individuals mix, the lower the 

risk of transmission, hospitalisation and deaths. 

•  Policy modelling illustrates that keeping Rt' lower (e.g. by the reduction of social 

mixing of people generally) would significantly reduce numbers of expected deaths 

and pressure on the NHS. 

•  Policy modelling suggests that introducing the equivalent of Tier 3 restrictions (e.g. 

closure of hospitality and entertainment, reduction in mixing) prior to the relaxation 

1  R, (Rat time t) is the current reproduction number, as opposed to Ro, the initial reproduction number of the virus.

of  restrictions before Christmas will  reduce the number of  hospital and  ICU  beds 

required for COVID-19 patients, and subsequent deaths. 

HT 

The most recent daily surveillance report (02 December 2020) shows a national  picture of 226 

cases per 100,000  with  a  13.3%  positivity.  For over 60s the national  seven  day case rate is 

176  cases  per 100,000  with  positivity  of  14.4%.  Blaenau  Gwent  and  Torfaen  are over  400 

cases per 100,000 with a positivity rate of 17.7 and 19.1 % respectively, which is growing closer 

to the pre-firebreak peak. 

The ONS  infection  survey data  shows that  test  positivity appears to  have  levelled  off  in  the 

most recent week (22 to 28 November 2020), after falling from a peak at the end of October2. 

The firebreak  had  the  intended  impact  of  a  short  sharp early  intervention  to  push  back  the 
3,4,6  The benefits of this period of  negative growth  have nearly 

epidemic by three to four weeks

been  lost,  with  case  numbers  and  hospital  admissions  nearly  reaching  levels  seen  at  the 

beginning of  the firebreak.  Rates of  transmission  are again  increasing across 15 of  22  local 

authorities.  Four  health  Boards areas (Aneurin  Bevan,  Cwm  Taf  Morgannwg  and  Swansea 

Bay) in  the very high category (200+ cases per 100K); Hywel  Da,  Powys and Betsi Cadwaladr 

would  be classed as high  (50+ cases per 100K). Whilst some areas, with  more  rural, smaller 

populations,  are  lower  (Gwynedd,  Anglesey,  Conwy),  Wales as a whole  is  very  high  (200+ 

cases per 100,000,  over 10%  positivity).  Increases  in  over 60s cases  per 100,000  reported 

across all  health  boards,  some of  which  will  be  accounted  for  by care  home outbreaks and 

also population  intergenerational mixing. 

The Official SAGE estimate of  Rt,  which  is a composite of several  models puts the national  Rt

in  confirmed  cases and  mobility since the firebreak which  suggests that  hospital  admissions 

and deaths may increase in  the next 2-3 weeks depending on the age structure of cases. 

Deaths  are  currently  as  high  as  May,  with  the  excess  death  rate  in  Wales  higher  than  in 

England and Scotland over recent weeks, and tracking above our reasonable worst case. NHS

beds,  admissions and hospitalisations  during  the  coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic  have 

been considered separately and are presented here. 

The modelled impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions on the growth of the epidemic in 

Wales have been described previously by TAG here. A TAG analysis of the effectiveness of 

the  local  health  protection  measures  and  the  Firebreak  in  Wales  can  be  found  here.  A 

comparison of the effectiveness of autumn interventions in the four nations by SAGE can be 

found  here.  Other  harms,  notably  socioeconomic  harms,  are  widely  acknowledged  to  be 

associated  with  non-pharmaceutical interventions.  A separate TAG  paper  considers  these 

harms alongside mitigation measures and can be found here. 

Christmas and winter celebrations 

Winter celebrations, like Christmas, will likely lead to increased intergenerational mixing and 

opportunities for the virus to spread to new networks of contacts, from pre-Christmas social 

mixing to extended household mixing at Christmas6. This is highly likely to provide increased 

opportunities for transmission of the disease. Increases in infections in older adults is likely to 

lead to higher deaths and hospitalisations after Christmas'. 

Whilst there are new technologies that will enable more rapid testing, these are not a silver 

bullet. Invariably new lateral flow devices will help reduce the lag in test to result and may 

enable  greater  freedoms  and  flexibility  of  testing;  however,  they  may  lack  comparable 

sensitivity to RT-PCR (Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction), the primary front line 

test for diagnosis of Covid-19 using a nasal swab from the nose or back of the throate'9. Social 

distancing and quarantining remains highly effective at reducing the risk of infecting 

others if observed correctly. 

The  central  premise  of  non-pharmaceutical  interventions  (NPIs)  is  to  reduce  the  risk  of 

transmission from infectious  people  to those  who are susceptible  to infection  by reducing 

mixing; this in turn reduces the risk of spread and large outbreaks. As rates of infection in the 

community rise before the Christmas period, it is likely that more people will need  to self-

isolate  or  quarantine  over  Christmas.  Pre-isolating  (e.g.  not  mixing  outside  of  the 

household) for one incubation  period (10  days) would  likely  be  an effective way of

lowering your risk of infecting others. If people become symptomatic during this period 

they should not see others and apply for a RT-PCR swab test immediately10. If people can 

avoid seeing others over the Christmas period, perhaps postponing celebrations until later 

next year or meeting remotely, then this is strongly advised. 

Pre-isolation may be a helpful consideration for families with children  before  visiting older 

relatives.  Similarly,  in  occupations  where  there  is  a  higher  odds  ratio  of  infection  (e.g. 

warehouse and factory workers, health and social care workers)", pre-isolation before mixing 

with older adults may reduce the risk of transmission 12. The best way to protect older family 

members is not to expose them to potential infection, no matter how well intended the 

reason for contact. It is likely that once a vaccine has been widely distributed the current 

restrictions will no longer be required. Until widespread  vaccination is undertaken, it will be 

important to equip people with some sensible advice about how to visit family members as 

safely as possible (e.g. reduced length of stay, good hand hygiene and ventilation). However, 

evidence  suggests  that most transmission  occurs due to prolonged,  close interaction  with 

familiar  people  in  a  home  environment,  and  that  pre-symptomatic  and  asymptomatic 

transmission can occur13. 

Recent  SAGE  papers  highlights  how  to  approach  Christmas  and  festivals  during  the 

pandemic14,15

Hospitality and Entertainment 

SAGE has considered the impacts of the hospitality on the epidemic and the associated risks; 

a summary can be found here. Work of the SAGE Environmental Modelling Group highlights 

that transmission risk is a combination of environmental and behavioural factors: higher risk 

contacts are those that are close, prolonged, indoors, face-to-face, in poorly ventilated and/or 

crowded spaces, or involve "loud" activities16. These are all prevalent in the hospitality sector 

(but not unique to it). The disinhibitory effects of alcohol on judgement, movement, memory

and  inhibitions  are  likely  to  exacerbate  difficulties  with  social  distancing  and  subsequent 

contact tracing. 

A review  of published  outbreak  clusters  conducted  in  April  2020  also  identified  numerous 

clusters associated with bars and households, although few clusters were found in schools". 

A report from  the  United  States  Centre  for Disease Control found  that  those  infected  with 

SARS-CoV-2  without  known  close  contact  with  a  person  with  confirmed  COVID-19,  case-

patients were 2.8 x more likely to report dining at a  restaurant (adjusted Odds Ratio; aOR = 

2.8, 95% Confidence Interval; Cl = 1.9-4.3) or 3.9x more likely to report going to a bar/coffee 

shop (aOR =  3.9, 95%  Cl  =  1.5-10.1) than were  control participants18.  Results  of the third 

Public  Health  England  epidemiological  investigation  into  high-risk  exposure  settings  for 

COVID-19 in  England using  data  collected  through  enhanced  contact tracing  and a  market 

research panel showed that certain occupational groups are associated with increased odds 

of  being  a  COVID-19  case,  including  working  in  warehouse  settings,  construction,  and 

hospitality,  as  well  as  health  and  social  care19.  Additionally,  there  was  strong  statistical 

evidence that engaging in entertainment activities was associated increased odds of disease. 

Test, Trace and  Protect (TTP) teams  collect exposure data  from  cases  and  contacts which 

relies  on  the  recall  of  those  being  interviewed  and  should  be  viewed  with  caution  in 

establishing  cause  and  effect.  Contact  tracing  was  not  designed  as  a  research  tool  or 

surveillance  system,  but  the  data  that  is  collected  does  provide  an  indicator  of  potential 

exposures that can then be evaluated for evidence of clustering. In a  recent survey of local 

authority (LA) cluster data undertaken between 21/09/20 and 20/10/20, a total of 176 clusters 

associated with commercial workplaces were reported by 10 LA environmental health teams 

in Wales. In the same TTP system, individual cases report exposure to pubs and restaurants 

relatively infrequently (<10%  of reported location exposures). Wet pubs and clubs (i.e. those 

venues predominantly serving alcohol) were the most common commercial setting associated 

with infection and accounted for 41 (23%) clusters. Enforcement data can provide an indication 

of  the  likelihood  of  infection  risk  associated  with  specific  commercial  settings.  Since  the 

introduction of the Restrictions  Regulations on 9th August (up to 20th November) a  total of 

295  Premises  Improvement  Notices  and  80  Premises  Closure  Notices  have  been  served, 

hospitality is  consistently the most common setting for service of these notices —  179 (61 %) 

improvement notices and 62 (78%) closure notices. Despite much effort from the industry to 

provide COVID secure environments, it is not possible to uncouple the linking activities that 

also  confer higher risks  of  transmission  (e.g.  transport  to  venue,  mixing  between  venues).

Further interpretation will require more accurate and detailed  recording of TTP data going 

forwards. 

Schools and education 

Cases and contacts identified  in school students  and teachers are increasing20. It is to be 

expected  that  numbers  of  school  students  and  school  staff in  self-isolation  as  a  'bubble' 

contact will continue to grow as cases in the community rise. 

The available evidence indicates that schools being open is associated with higher rates of 

infection in the population, although there is no clear evidence of a causative relationship; the 

mechanism for any association may be complex (potentially including many factors such as 

reopening  of  workplaces,  parents  returning  to  work,  shops  and  hospitality,  social  mixing 

outside schools that links households and different networks together)21. It is also the case 

that during the pandemic, closing schools has been one of the NPIs most often deployed at a 

late stage i.e. when transmission was already at a high level. Movement data from the first 

and second week of the autumn firebreak in Wales suggests that schools being open is likely 

to lead to increased mobility22. 

Ordinarily closing schools should be the last intervention to be considered, due to the balance 

of risks of short term and longer term harm to children in terms of physical, mental health and 

well-being  and  learning.  However,  agreement  for  the  formation  of  extended  Christmas 

bubbles increases the risk of transmission within extended and intergenerational households 

during this period. The decision to partially close schools in the second week of the autumn 

firebreak took account of earlier SAGE advice on the modelled impacts23. In November, SAGE 

endorsed  a  paper  which  stated  "As  the  prevalence  of infection  in  children  aged  12-16 

increased between September and October, ONS analysis suggests that children aged 12-16 

played a significantly higher role in introducing infection into households (medium confidence). 

The difference is less marked for younger children (medium confidence)'rz4. A period of pre-

isolation for families with children as a result of school closures could reduce the level of social 

mixing ahead of 23-28 December if school attendance and wider social mixing associated with 

schools being open was not replaced by other social mixing activities.

Potential  options  for reducing  the  significant  educational  and  wider  socio-economic  harms 

resulting  from  school  closures  have  been  set  out  elsewhere  in  advice  to  Ministers  and 

considered previously, such as remote learning for some or all school pupils, opening a limited 

number of  hub' schools for children of essential workers and vulnerable children, or shortening 

school holiday periods over the summer to allow for more learning. However, the risk remains 

of  these  mitigations  increasing  inequality  as  online  learning  is  less  accessible  to  lower 

socioeconomic groups. The deliverability and effectiveness of any mitigating measures should 

be considered in a careful risk/benefit approach. 

For decisions on whether any school closures should take place beyond the Christmas period, 

it will be important to consider further evidence as this becomes available, given the significant 

wider harms caused by school closures. 

If learning transitioned to a blended period for the final week of term, consideration would need 

to  be  given  to  displacement  activities  that  could  see  more  mixing  (e.g.  through  leisure  or 

shopping). If agreed, the week should be used for isolation and reducing social contacts, with 

a clear  stay at home' message for all age groups. 

Behaviours and Risk Communication 

Whilst  we  would  recommend  continuing  to  pursue  the  agenda  of shared  responsibility  for 

longer  term  behaviour change,  it is  clear that  some  members of society, for a  multitude  of 

reasons, are not adhering to aspects of the guidelines in place. This adherence is required for 

individuals to protect themselves and others and it is important to recognise that what might 

be considered minor breaches may have a bigger impact at population level when compared 

to a small minority taking significant risks25. 

Evidence to date suggests many people continue to adhere to the guidelines in Wales, with 

exceptions  largely  being  thought  to  be  associated  with  barriers  such  as  understanding  of 

guidelines, lack of skills (e.g. ability to say no) and  lack  of access to support (e.g. financial, 

practical and emotional). Furthermore, while confidence in Welsh Government remains high, 

an important consideration given it has been found to be a key predictor of adherence26, there 

will be some people who disagree with the restrictions that have been in place and are less 

likely to comply.  Survey data also suggest a  degree of mixing in the home with those

outside the extended household and misunderstanding in the population of the risks 

of transmission associated with such mixing (e.g. reporting they  are more likely to be 

exposed to the virus from strangers than family/friends 27). Objective mobility data also 

indicate returns to pre-firebreak levels of travel. 

While a little more speculative, current circumstances may exacerbate the risk of transmission 

in the community. For example: 

•  Changing  behaviours  following  the  relaxing  of  restrictions  post-firebreak  (largely 

anecdotal but survey data will allow this to be routinely monitored). 

•  Greater mixing in the pre-Christmas period is likely, in for example, hospitality settings 

and non-essential retail. 

•  Possible  complacency  with  the  welcome  news  on  the  forthcoming  availability  of 

vaccines, a recent qualitative study noting the possibility of people relaxing28, (although 

a counter-argument is feasible, where people continue to be cautious as they can now 

see an end in sight). 

While  the  trajectory  of the  pandemic  has  changed  over  time,  in  part  due  to  the  various 

interventions put in place, many of the evidence-informed behavioural considerations remain 

the same as in the spring (and outlined in the recent TAC paper29). These include: 

•  The importance of public communication around risk that is both simple to understand 

and accompanied by a clear rationale. This would be particularly pertinent were there 

to be a deviation from the post-firebreak national approach (e.g. to localities in different 

tiers as in England and Scotland). That said, perceived consistency across the UK 

would likely be viewed positively, as has been agreed for the Christmas period. 

•  Financial support in place should be continued (e.g. £500 self-isolation payments) and 

other  forms  of social  and  emotional  support  encouraged  (e.g.  family,  friends  and 

volunteers keeping in touch and providing practical support such as shopping). 

Use  of  appropriate  communication  channels  reflecting  demographic  and  cultural 

differences and interventions co-produced wherever possible. 

•  Recognising enforcement should not be a  focus of any activity without having first 

attempted  to  engage,  explain  and  encourage  and  remaining  aware  of  the  risk  of 

inequitable deployment.

The importance of  considering those behaviours more likely during the festive season, some 

of which are drawn  out above, also need to be factored in, with a number of SAGE/SPI-B 

papers  that  should  be  drawn  on  in  order  to  minimise  the  risk  of  transmission  and  the 

behavioural insights to assist  in doing so30

Policy modelling 

From analysis  we  have  undertaken  and  comparisons  of interventions  across  the  UK  with 

SAGE, we can see that: it is better to intervene early than late; short and sharp interventions 

work; adherence wanes over time; and firebreaks and harder restrictions (e.g. tier 3+) can 

reduce levels of transmission in the community. Rules must be simple, understandable and 
achievable —  with an agreed beginning and end31.32.3334,35 

SAGE agree that it is better to enter into the Christmas period with a low level of community 

transmission as opposed to high36. As we have seen from our hospitals, care homes, and 

prisons, high community prevalence leads to outbreaks in these settings and outbreaks spread 

quickly. The same logic can be applied to residential settings — if an infectious individual enters 

a multiple occupancy home is it likely that more than one other person will become infected. 

A new Reasonable Worst Case scenario has been produced and will be published shortly. 

An analysis of different policy options has been undertaken by Swansea University to model 
the potential impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions37 38 in the pre and post-Christmas 
period. The policy scenarios considered transmission levels indicative of either a Scottish level 

2 or 3 or England tier 2 or 3 period before Christmas. Herein tier 2 and tier 3 are used to 

describe a similar level of transmission and mixing to that associated with Tier 2 and Tier 3 

restrictions described  in the SAGE paper on four nations NPI analysis here (page 5). The 

transmission rate scenarios were chosen based on a pre-firebreak (as at 16 October) Rt value

of  1.3,  and  a 10% higher value  representing  increased seasonal transmission going  into the 

winter. 

The analysis was helpful as it illustrated the potential  benefits in  terms of  reduction  in  deaths, 

NHS occupancy and ICU bed for tier 2 and 3 scenarios. The model also illustrates that keeping 

Rc  generally  lower  (e.g.  by  the  reduction  of  social  mixing  of  people  generally)  would 

significantly impact on  deaths: Rt1.3 (2,520 deaths) versus R1 .4 (3,270 deaths), if  we include 

deaths  from  1  December  until  28  February.  The  estimates  do  not  factor  in  any  non-

pharmaceutical interventions after Christmas, or likely COVID-19 deaths over the springtime. 

The  Figures  below show the  modelled  effects of  6  different  pre-Christmas  policy scenarios. 

Each  of  the scenarios can  be  read  from  left  to  right,  from  the  recent date  of  2/12/20,  to the 

start of  the  period  of  reduced  restrictions (23/12/20),  up  until  the  end  of  the  post-Christmas 

period of reduced restrictions (28/12/20). The red section of the line indicates additional mixing 

during the Christmas period, estimated to result in  a further 10% additional transmission. 

For example, in the first 'No intervention' scenario, where the background Rt is assumed to be 

1.3 (as of  2/12/20), the cumulative  number of  COVID-19  patients  requiring  hospital and  ICU 

beds is estimated  to  be 8,570 and  1,030  respectively,  with  2,520 deaths. In  the third  'Tier 3'

If  the background  Rt is higher, at 1.4, then the number of  hospital and  ICU  beds required, and 

deaths, will  be higher overall, as per last 3 scenarios in  the Figure below.
