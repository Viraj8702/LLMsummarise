Leisure and fitness facilities (gyms, swimming pools, spas, fitness studios) will be closed in Tier 4.
Supermarkets will be open at all levels as considered essential (though they are of course expected
to follow the reasonable measures in the guidance to keep people safe). The only restriction on
supermarkets in Tier 4 could be the sale of non-essential items and | am waiting for clarification on
this point.

~ TriniSters. ipulanies for the oversight.

1. Unlicenced music events — the FM agreed to maintain the option of a £10,000 fixed penalty
which meets the deterrent the police would prefer, after being satisfied that our legitimate concerns
for access to justice are met through it being made very clear to recipients of an FPN that they have
the ability to reject the FPN and argue their case in court, albeit at risk of an unlimited fine.

2. Penalties for businesses — it was agreed to create a new offence of failure to comply with the
terms of a Premises Improvement Notice, with an FPN available to LA enforcement officers starting at
£1000 and rising on subsequent occasions. This was actioned in the Regs that came into force last
Friday.

3. Failure to self-isolate following international travel, the FM agreed to reduce the FPN
value from a fixed £1000 to an initial £500 (rising on subsequent occasions). This would apply to the
main offence and also to linked offences such as obstructing an enforcement officer in pursuit of this
offence. This is being actioned in this week’s international travel regulations which come into force on
Saturday morning.

4. Organising an event of over 15 people indoors or over 30 people outdoors (ie the house
parties offence) - the FM agreed to increase the FPN value from an initial £200 to an initial £500
(rising on subsequent occasions). This will be included in next week’s Regs introducing the “traffic
lights” system. Comms are working on materials to announce the increase and emphasise the
importance of not holding parties.

5. Penalty for international travel operators failing to give information to travellers — it was
agreed to reduce this from a fixed £4000 to an initial £1000, rising on subsequent occasions. This is
being actioned in this week’s international travel regulations which come into force on Saturday
morning.

6. The FM was not convinced by the argument at para 30, against creating a further offence for
“reckless” breaches of the general self-isolation requirements, with a higher value FPN that
equates more closely with the penalty for failure to self-isolate following international travel. He noted
that this model seemed to work in England and suggested that police officers must be experienced in
handling cases involving the concept of ‘recklessness’. We are testing this with stakeholders and will
come back with further advice.

INQ000350094_0005

ie Ministers agreed the recommendation of having a systematic review to ensure there is clarity
about the respective roles and responsibilities of different enforcing authorities for each offence (for
example ensuring there are no settings where certain regulations are unintentionally not being
enforced). We are considering how to take this forward.

8. Ministers also agreed that discussion should take place with all enforcing authorities to ensure
there is a shared understanding of what offences are most serious in the Covid context, and that the

law enforcement response is appropriate to the level of seriousness. Again, we are considering how

to take this forward.

Thanks very much

Subject: RE: MA/FM/3803/20- Review of post-firebreak restrictions

| Name Redacted |

Apologies for the time it has taken to get you the CG’s final views on this — officials have been
discussing with him through the week.

On the unlicenced music events, following further information provided to him in light of initial
questions, the CG’s conclusion was that in light of the fact that these generally end up in court, it
seems to him that we have the option of retaining the £10k fine which meets the deterrent the police
would prefer, whilst being satisfied that our legitimate concerns for access to justice are met. He is
therefore content for it to be retained (contrary to the advice in the MA).

He was content with all the proposals in the review relating to penalties for businesses.

On penalties relating to failure to self-isolate following international travel, the CG suggested that
a £200 FPN as proposed felt out of kilter with the levels elsewhere in the UK in a policy area where
there has been a reasonable amount of consistency, so suggested we reflect the Scottish levels — on
which basis we would recommend the FPN value is set at £500 (rising on subsequent occasions).

Finally, as a knock on consequence of the above, we suggested to the CG and he agreed that it
might be sensible to also increase the penalty for organising an event of over 15 people indoors
or over 30 people outdoors (ie the house parties offence), so that this too was set at £500.

The first benefit of making this change is that other than for offences committed by businesses and
the music events offence, we would have limited ourselves to two scales of penalty: one starting at
£60 for most offences, and one starting at £500 for the more serious offences. This brings more
coherence than having one offence only where the scale starts at £200, and a limited number where
the scale then starts at £500.

INQ000350094_0007

More important, though, is that we know house parties are continuing to be organised. Last week
alone Gwent Police report attending 24 (other forces have not given precise numbers). Given the high
risk of spread at these and current high incidence rates among under 25s, attempting a more
powerful deterrent appears reasonable, especially to coincide with pubs being closed in evenings,
which will increase the incentive to organise parties. Comms advise that this would fit well with our
planned messages for next week and should receive significant coverage, which could be beneficial
in conveying the dangerousness of holding these events. Legal services agree that this would be
rational.

For completeness, the other comments we received on the FPNs review were from the Minister for
Housing and Local Government who had said “I’m actually happy with all the recommendations set
out here, they seem to me to be proportionate and they answer some of the concerns | had
previously expressed about the FPN regime. | particularly welcome the suggested review across all
enforcement agencies”; and from the Deputy Minister and Chief Whip, who had flagged that Alun
Michael did not support the case for removing the £10,000 FPN for unlicenced music events.

When we have the FM’s views on these issues, we can include in the regulations to come into force
next Friday and in the covering MA as necessary.

Thanks,

JAMES ones

The First Minister has considered this MA. He has agreed to retain the current restrictions, and
approved the draft Written Statement at doc 2.

We will respond on the CMO Statement in the morning as that followed later.

In relation to the review of FPNs at Doc 5, the First Minister does not feel able to agree in principle to
the amendments proposed, without some further discussion. He has asked for:

1. The view of the CG.

2. Further information on the first proposal on unlicensed music events. Was there something
earlier in the week about a decision not to invoke any further penalties of this sort in England until the
issue of court level penalties being awarded is addressed? If that is the case, would it make any
different to the views of our own police?

cs The remaining proposals seems less contentious, but he would still rather not proceed without
Ministerial colleagues having an opportunity to comment.

Private offices — grateful if you could confirm that Ministers have considered the review of FPN’s at
doc 5 please and send any comments as soon as possible. The First Minister would like to make a
final decision on Monday.
