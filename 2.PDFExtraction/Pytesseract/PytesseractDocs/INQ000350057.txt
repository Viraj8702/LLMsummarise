Technical Advisory Group
Statement regarding NPIis in the pre-Christmas period

2.4 December 2020

The purpose of this paper is to set out the technical and scientific rationale for the introduction

of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) in Wales in the pre-Christmas period.

Take home messages

e The virus spreads when an infected individual comes into contact with an
uninfected individual(s). The likelihood of a contact between an infected individual
and an uninfected individual resulting in a transmission is dependent upon the
nature of the contact. Some environments and behaviours are more likely to
enabie the virus to transmit.

e Social distancing and quarantining remains highly effective at reducing the risk of
infecting others, if observed correctly. Pre-isolating (e.g. not mixing outside of the
household) for one incubation period (10 days) would be an effective way of
lowering your risk of infecting others. Self-isolation remains of paramount
importance for anyone with COVID-19 symptoms.

e The best way to protect older family members is not to expose them to potential
infection, no matter how well-intended the reason for contact.

e Survey data suggests evidence of household-mixing with those outside of the
extended household. This is accompanied by a misunderstanding of the risks of
transmission associated with mixing. Evidence suggests that increased mixing of
households and individuals in indoor settings poses a substantial risk of
transmission. Therefore, the fewer households and individuals mix, the lower the
risk of transmission, hospitalisation and deaths.

e Policy modelling illustrates that keeping R,' lower (e.g. by the reduction of social
mixing of people generally) would significantly reduce numbers of expected deaths
and pressure on the NHS.

e Policy modelling suggests that introducing the equivalent of Tier 3 restrictions (e.g.

closure of hospitality and entertainment, reduction in mixing) prior to the relaxation

‘R(R at time t) is the current reproduction number, as opposed to Ro the initial reproduction number of the virus.

of restrictions before Christmas will reduce the number of hospital and ICU beds

required for COVID-19 patients, and subsequent deaths.

Situation

The most recent daily surveillance report (02 December 2020) shows a national picture of 226
cases per 100,000 with a 13.3% positivity. For over GOs the national seven day case rate is
176 cases per 100,000 with positivity of 14.4%. Blaenau Gwent and Torfaen are over 400
cases per 100,000 with a positivity rate of 17.7 and 19.1% respectively, which is growing closer

to the pre-firebreak peak.

The ONS infection survey data shows thai test positivity appears to have levelled off in the
most recent week (22 to 28 November 2020), after falling from a peak at the end of October’.
The firebreak had the intended impact of a short sharp early intervention to push back the
epidemic by three to four weeks**°. The benefits of this period of negative growth have nearly
been lost, with case numbers and hospital admissions nearly reaching levels seen at the
beginning of the firebreak. Rates of transmission are again increasing across 15 of 22 local
authorities. Four health Boards areas (Aneurin Bevan, Cwm Taf Morgannwg and Swansea
Bay) in the very high category (200+ cases per 100K); Hywel Da, Powys and Betsi Cadwaladr
would be classed as high (50+ cases per 100K). Whilst some areas, with more rural, smaller
populations, are lower (Gwynedd, Anglesey, Conwy), Wales as a whole is very high (200+
cases per 100,000, over 10% positivity). Increases in over 60s cases per 100,000 reported
across all health boards, some of which will be accounted for by care home outbreaks and

also population intergenerational mixing.

The Official SAGE estimate of Ri, which is a composite of several models puts the national Ri
between 0.8-1.1, a higher range than the previous week. Wales has seen a greater increase
in confirmed cases and mobility since the firebreak which suggests that hospital admissions

and deaths may increase in the next 2-3 weeks depending on the age structure of cases.

Deaths are currently as high as May, with the excess death rate in Wales higher than in

England and Scotland over recent weeks, and tracking above our reasonable worst case. NHS

been considered separately and are presented here.

The modelled impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions on the growth of the epidemic in
Wales have been described previously by TAG here. A TAG analysis of the effectiveness of
the local health protection measures and the Firebreak in Wales can be found here. A
comparison of the effectiveness of autumn interventions in the four nations by SAGE can be
found here. Other harms, notably socioeconomic harms, are widely acknowledged to be
associated with non-pharmaceutical interventions. A separate TAG paper considers these

harms alongside mitigation measures and can be found here.

Christmas and winter celebrations

Winter celebrations, like Christmas, will likely lead to increased intergenerational mixing and
opportunities for the virus to spread to new networks of contacts, from pre-Christmas social
mixing to extended household mixing at Christmas®. This is highly likely to provide increased
opportunities for transmission of the disease. Increases in infections in older adults is likely to

lead to higher deaths and hospitalisations after Christmas’.

Whilst there are new technologies that will enable more rapid testing, these are not a silver
bullet. Invariably new lateral flow devices will help reduce the lag in test to result and may
enable greater freedoms and flexibility of testing; however, they may lack comparable
sensitivity to RT-PCR (Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction), the primary front line
test for diagnosis of Covid-19 using a nasal swab from the nose or back of the throat®°. Social
distancing and quarantining remains highly effective at reducing the risk of infecting

others if observed correctly.

The central premise of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) is to reduce the risk of
transmission from infectious people to those who are susceptible to infection by reducing
mixing; this in turn reduces the risk of spread and large outbreaks. As rates of infection in the
community rise before the Christmas period, it is likely that more people will need to self-
isolate or quarantine over Christmas. Pre-isolating (e.g. not mixing outside of the

household) for one incubation period (10 days) would likely be an effective way of

lowering your risk of infecting others. If people become symptomatic during this period
they should not see others and apply for a RT-PCR swab test immediately'®. If people can
avoid seeing others over the Christmas period, perhaps postponing celebrations until later

next year or meeting remotely, then this is strongly advised.

Pre-isolation may be a helpful consideration for families with children before visiting older
relatives. Similarly, in occupations where there is a higher odds ratio of infection (e.g.
warehouse and factory workers, health and social care workers)'', pre-isolation before mixing
with older adults may reduce the risk of transmission'*. The best way to protect older family
members is not to expose them to potential infection, no matter how well intended the
reason for contact. It is likely that once a vaccine has been widely distributed the current
restrictions will no longer be required. Until widespread vaccination is undertaken, it will be
important to equip people with some sensible advice about how to visit family members as
safely as possible (e.g. reduced length of stay, good hand hygiene and ventilation). However,
evidence suggests that most transmission occurs due to prolonged, close interaction with
familiar people in a home environment, and that pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic

transmission can occur".

pandemic"*">,

Hospitality and Entertainment

SAGE has considered the impacts of the hospitality on the epidemic and the associated risks;
a summary can be found here. Work of the SAGE Environmental Modelling Group highlights
that transmission risk is a combination of environmental and behavioural factors: higher risk
contacts are those that are close, prolonged, indoors, face-to-face, in poorly ventilated and/or
crowded spaces, or involve “loud” activities'®. These are all prevalent in the hospitality sector

(but not unique to it). The disinhibitory effects of alcohol on judgement, movement, memory

and inhibitions are likely to exacerbate difficulties with social distancing and subsequent

contact tracing.

A review of published outbreak clusters conducted in April 2020 also identified numerous
clusters associated with bars and households, although few clusters were found in schools".
A report from the United States Centre for Disease Control found that those infected with
SARS-CoV-2 without known close contact with a person with confirmed COVID-19, case-
patients were 2.8 x more likely to report dining at a restaurant (adjusted Odds Ratio; aOR =
2.8, 95% Confidence Interval; Cl = 1.9-4.3) or 3.9x more likely to report going to a bar/coffee
shop (aOR = 3.9, 95% Cl = 1.5-10.1) than were control participants'®. Results of the third
Public Health England epidemiological investigation into high-risk exposure settings for
COVID-19 in England using data collected through enhanced contact tracing and a market
research panel showed that certain occupational groups are associated with increased odds
of being a COVID-19 case, including working in warehouse settings, construction, and
hospitality, as well as health and social care’®. Additionally, there was strong statistical

evidence that engaging in entertainment activities was associated increased odds of disease.

Test, Trace and Protect (TTP) teams collect exposure data from cases and contacts which
relies on the recall of those being interviewed and should be viewed with caution in
establishing cause and effect. Contact tracing was not designed as a research tool or
surveillance system, but the data that is collected does provide an indicator of potential
exposures that can then be evaluated for evidence of clustering. In a recent survey of local
authority (LA) cluster data undertaken between 21/09/20 and 20/10/20, a total of 176 clusters
associated with commercial workplaces were reported by 10 LA environmental health teams
in Wales. In the same TTP system, individual cases report exposure to pubs and restaurants
relatively infrequently (<10% of reported location exposures). Wet pubs and clubs (i.e. those
venues predominantly serving alcohol) were the most common commercial setting associated
with infection and accounted for 41 (23%) clusters. Enforcement data can provide an indication
of the likelihood of infection risk associated with specific commercial settings. Since the
introduction of the Restrictions Regulations on 9th August (up to 20th November) a total of
295 Premises Improvement Notices and 80 Premises Closure Notices have been served,
hospitality is consistently the most common setting for service of these notices — 179 (61%)
improvement notices and 62 (78%) closure notices. Despite much effort from the industry to
provide COVID secure environments, it is not possible to uncouple the linking activities that

also confer higher risks of transmission (e.g. transport to venue, mixing between venues).

Further interpretation will require more accurate and detailed recording of TTP data going

forwards.

Schools and education

Cases and contacts identified in school students and teachers are increasing’. It is to be
expected that numbers of school students and school staff in self-isolation as a ‘bubble’

contact will continue to grow as cases in the community rise.

The available evidence indicates that schools being open is associated with higher rates of
infection in the population, although there is no clear evidence of a causative relationship; the
mechanism for any association may be complex (potentially including many factors such as
reopening of workplaces, parents returning to work, shops and hospitality, social mixing
outside schools that links households and different networks together)’. It is also the case
that during the pandemic, closing schools has been one of the NPIs most often deployed at a
late stage i.e. when transmission was already at a high level. Movement data from the first
and second week of the autumn firebreak in Wales suggests that schools being open is likely

to lead to increased mobility”.

Ordinarily closing schools should be the last intervention to be considered, due to the balance
of risks of short term and longer term harm to children in terms of physical, mental health and
well-being and learning. However, agreement for the formation of extended Christmas
bubbles increases the risk of transmission within extended and intergenerational households
during this period. The decision to partially close schools in the second week of the autumn
firebreak took account of earlier SAGE advice on the modelled impacts’. In November, SAGE
endorsed a paper which stated “As the prevalence of infection in children aged 12-16
increased between September and October, ONS analysis suggests that children aged 12-16
played a significantly higher role in introducing infection into households (medium confidence).
The difference is less marked for younger children (medium confidence)”*. A period of pre-
isolation for families with children as a result of school closures could reduce the level of social
mixing ahead of 23-28 December if school attendance and wider social mixing associated with

schools being open was not replaced by other social mixing activities.

Potential options for reducing the significant educational and wider socio-economic harms
resulting from school closures have been set out elsewhere in advice to Ministers and
considered previously, such as remote learning for some or all school pupils, opening a limited
number of ‘hub’ schools for children of essential workers and vulnerable children, or shortening
school holiday periods over the summer to allow for more learning. However, the risk remains
of these mitigations increasing inequality as online learning is less accessible to lower
socioeconomic groups. The deliverability and effectiveness of any mitigating measures should

be considered in a careful risk/benefit approach.

For decisions on whether any school closures should take place beyond the Christmas period,
it will be important to consider further evidence as this becomes available, given the significant

wider harms caused by school closures.

if learning transitioned to a blended period for the final week of term, consideration would need
to be given to displacement activities that could see more mixing (e.g. through leisure or
shopping). If agreed, the week should be used for isolation and reducing social contacts, with

a clear ‘stay at home’ message for all age groups.

Behaviours and Risk Communication

Whilst we would recommend continuing to pursue the agenda of shared responsibility for
longer term behaviour change, it is clear that some members of society, for a multitude of
reasons, are not adhering to aspects of the guidelines in place. This adherence is required for
individuals to protect themselves and others and it is important to recognise that what might
be considered minor breaches may have a bigger impact at population level wnen compared

to a small minority taking significant risks®.

Evidence to date suggests many people continue to adhere to the guidelines in Wales, with
exceptions largely being thought to be associated with barriers such as understanding of
guidelines, lack of skills (e.g. ability to say no) and lack of access to support (e.g. financial,
practical and emotional). Furthermore, while confidence in Welsh Government remains high,
an important consideration given it has been found to be a key predictor of adherence, there
will be some people who disagree with the restrictions that have been in place and are less

likely to comply. Survey data also suggest a degree of mixing in the home with those

outside the extended household and misunderstanding in the population of the risks
of transmission associated with such mixing (e.g. reporting they are more likely to be
exposed to the virus from strangers than family/friends 2’). Objective mobility data also

indicate returns to pre-firebreak levels of travel.

While a little more speculative, current circumstances may exacerbate the risk of transmission

in the community. For example:

e Changing behaviours following the relaxing of restrictions post-firebreak (largely
anecdotal but survey data will allow this to be routinely monitored).

« Greater mixing in the pre-Christmas period is likely, in for example, hospitality settings
and non-essential retail.

« Possible complacency with the welcome news on the forthcoming availability of
vaccines, a recent qualitative study noting the possibility of people relaxing’°, (although
a counter-argument is feasible, where people continue to be cautious as they can now

see an end in sight).

While the trajectory of the pandemic has changed over time, in part due to the various
interventions put in place, many of the evidence-informed behavioural considerations remain

the same as in the spring (and outlined in the recent TAC paper?’). These include:

e The importance of public communication around risk that is both simple to understand
and accompanied by a clear rationale. This would be particularly pertinent were there
to be a deviation from the post-firebreak national approach (e.g. to localities in different
tiers as in England and Scotland). That said, perceived consistency across the UK
would likely be viewed positively, as has been agreed for the Christmas period.

e Financial support in place should be continued (e.g. £500 self-isolation payments) and
other forms of social and emotional support encouraged (e.g. family, friends and
volunteers keeping in touch and providing practical support such as shopping).

e Use of appropriate communication channels reflecting demographic and cultural
differences and interventions co-produced wherever possible.

e Recognising enforcement should not be a focus of any activity without having first
attempted to engage, explain and encourage and remaining aware of the risk of

inequitable deployment.

The importance of considering those behaviours more likely during the festive season, some
of which are drawn out above, also need to be factored in, with a number of SAGE/SPI-B
papers that should be drawn on in order to minimise the risk of transmission and the

behavioural insights to assist in doing so”.

Policy modelling

From analysis we have undertaken and comparisons of interventions across the UK with
SAGE, we can see that: it is better to intervene early than late; short and sharp interventions
work; adherence wanes over time; and firebreaks and harder restrictions (e.g. tier 3+) can
reduce levels of transmission in the community. Rules must be simple, understandable and

achievable — with an agreed beginning and end?132.93:94:99.

SAGE agree that it is better to enter into the Christmas period with a low level of community
transmission as opposed to high*®. As we have seen from our hospitals, care homes, and
prisons, high community prevalence leads to outbreaks in these settings and outbreaks spread
quickly. The same logic can be applied to residential settings — if an infectious individual enters

a multiple occupancy home is it likely that more than one other person will become infected.
A new Reasonable Worst Case scenario has been produced and will be published shortly.

An analysis of different policy options has been undertaken by Swansea University to model
the potential impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions®*’”** in the pre and post-Christmas
period. The policy scenarios considered transmission levels indicative of either a Scottish level
2 or 3 or England tier 2 or 3 period before Christmas. Herein tier 2 and tier 3 are used to
describe a similar level of transmission and mixing to that associated with Tier 2 and Tier 3
restrictions described in the SAGE paper on four nations NPI analysis here (page 5). The

transmission rate scenarios were chosen based on a pre-firebreak (as at 16 October) R; value

of 1.3, and a 10% higher value representing increased seasonal transmission going into the

winter.

The analysis was heipful as it illustrated the potential benefits in terms of reduction in deaths,
NHS occupancy and ICU bed for tier 2 and 3 scenarios. The model also illustrates that keeping
R: generally lower (e.g. by the reduction of social mixing of people generally) would
significantly impact on deaths: Ri1.3 (2,520 deaths) versus Ri1.4 (3,270 deaths), if we include
deaths from 1 December until 28 February. The estimates do not factor in any non-

pharmaceutical interventions after Christmas, or likely COVID-19 deaths over the springtime.

The Figures below show the modelled effects of 6 different pre-Christmas policy scenarios.
Each of the scenarios can be read from left to right, from the recent date of 2/12/20, to the
start of the period of reduced restrictions (23/12/20), up until the end of the post-Christmas
period of reduced restrictions (28/12/20). The red section of the line indicates additional mixing

during the Christmas period, estimated to result in a further 10% additional transmission.

For example, in the first ‘No intervention’ scenario, where the background R; is assumed to be
1.3 (as of 2/12/20), the cumulative number of COVID-19 patients requiring hospital and ICU
beds is estimated to be 8,570 and 1,030 respectively, with 2,520 deaths. In the third ‘Tier 3’
pre-Christmas intervention, which is estimated to bring Ri down from the background Rt of 1.3,
to below 1 (0.9), the number the cumulative number of hospital and ICU beds is estimated to
reduce to 4,860 and 580 respectively, with 1,460 deaths.

If the background Riis higher, at 1.4, then the number of hospital and ICU beds required, and

deaths, will be higher overall, as per last 3 scenarios in the Figure below.

In summary, policy modelling suggests that introducing Tier 3 restrictions (e.g. closure
of hospitality and entertainment, reduction in mixing) prior to the relaxation of
restrictions before Christmas will reduce the number of hospital and ICU beds required
for COVID-19 patients, and deaths.
