Subject: RE: PHW/WG - National Assessment

Dear All,
Ahead of our meeting at 2pm, | have put some high level points that could help us focus the discussion. This is only a
guide (not an exhaustive list)

1. Key strategic intent

- what is the strategy for Wales?

O options — is it suppression followed by ambition for elimination or is it suppression to an acceptable baseline
endemicity until vaccine/treatment available?

O If aiming for elimination — are we in a position to deal with the collateral damage that comes from that effort —
e.g. economy, jobs, interrupted education

O If aiming for acceptable baseline endemicity — what level should it be set at? what are the options to protect
vulnerable groups under this strategy

2k Where will the current picture take us to in a few weeks time?

- Case incidence will continue to rise — including to 200/100000 7 day rolling incidence by end of October
- Associated hospital admission will go up — proportion to ITU will go up

- Deaths going up

- outbreaks in Health care settings and care homes

- university outbreaks will contribute to significant new case burden.

3. What does global experience suggest?
Countries that have gone for suppression followed by intent to eliminate have 3 key factors in their success
O Very stringent border control to keep imported infections to a lowest possible effect
7 stopping all non-essential travel
7 strict enforcement of returning traveller quarantining and evidencing it
O Highly functional test, trace and isolate programme —
7 unlimited access to rapid testing and results (symptom onset to test result back with patient in 24hrs; all

successful contact traced and isolated within next 24 hrs- so an end-to-end process around a given case all completed in
48hrs)

INQ000385719 0001

7 Financial incentives for people needing to isolate — to the extent that the benefits would be comparable to the
levels they would earn, had they been at work

7 system capacity for Wales to deal with at least 2000 new cases per day and upto 10,000 contacts from them

O very clear messaging to communities outlining the roadmap with clear guidance and explanation on why certain
measures are in place, what benefit will they bring about, how long will those have to be in place, how can the public
know whether that is working or not?

4. What options do we have and when do we need to enact them?

- continue with current approach — local and hyper-local lockdowns — they will soon become ineffective

- go for additional national interventions — what are those? when do we enact and how long for?

- what do we do in the longer term?

Hope that can be of some help
regards
Giri
