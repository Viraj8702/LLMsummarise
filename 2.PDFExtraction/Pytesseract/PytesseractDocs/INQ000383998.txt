The Minister has agreed the recommendations but has a number of questions he would like
answered before the plan can be published.

“I'd like to know how the testing numbers are generated and how robust they are.

[numbers are generated by PHW, orders have been placed for new machines and should be in place
on projected dates — however given demand on suppliers there are some risks, which we will track]

7. Capital procurement of 4 Starlet and six Nimbus platforms (ordered)

Zz. Capital procurement of the Eplex systems (ordered)

= Delivery of testing reagents for the current Nimbus platform at UHW by 27 March 2020

4. Confirmation of 500 daily tests on Roche platform and operational by TBC (before 30 April
2020)

5: Receipt of 15' Starlet at UHW by 13 April 2020

6. Receipt of 2°97 and 3 Starlets at Singleton and Glan Clwyd by 30 April 2020

r. Go live of the Biofire test by 30 April 2020

8. Go live of the 4‘ Starlet at Royal Gwent and the six Nimbus machines across Wales by 15
May 2020

9. Go live of the Eplex systems by 15 May 2020.

“Last week | said we would have an extra 5000 tests. As we know Roche let us down.

“However | also said that we have a further 1000 tests the following week. The numbers in this plan
don’t match that. Are the numbers in the plan expanding our own capacity in Wales and not reliant
upon UK initiatives that are also referred to.

The numbers from PHW
- Moving from 500 to 800 tests a day from today.
- Moving to 1100 tests a day from the middle of next week
- By the middle of April should around 1900 per day
- By the end of April we hope to be around 3000 a day
There will also continue to be an increase as additional equipment comes on line through early May
whieh will give us a further 3000 tests a day.

None of this depends on Boots/Amazon — that would be a fall-back.

“’’m also aware of work with universities and other pharma offers that may add to capacity. Are the
numbers in the plan reliant on that at all?

No, but we are actively exploring this as an additional option.
“The data linking is really positive. We should definitely highlight the fact that we are in a better

position than other UK nations in our press release. We should positively set out that this is good for
Wales and we will be sharing what we learn with other nations as part of the fight against COVID.”

| agree, we should drive power from our SAIL...
