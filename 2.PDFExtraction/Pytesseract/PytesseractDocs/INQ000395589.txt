We do need a handle on HCW deaths ourselves.
The decision on what can be shared is then a separate issue we can consider with Heather’s guidance | feel.

In meeting with Minister where he agreed we hold our line that there is no reporting on NHS staff
deaths, in Wales, by PHW.

Could note that PHW are not reporting on overall deaths wrt local authority area (as in England) given
lower commensurate numbers which can lead to identification.

(To note that Health Boards are reporting on staff deaths, and in some cases family of deceased NHS
staff are disclosing details in public domain.)

Dear colleagues,

Peter was also on the call so may have more notes.

Brief notes:

Deaths/sit rep data:

Update that death of a patient in the Nightingale facility (London) last night
England +661 deaths, total 11666 (needs verification still)

NI +10, total 134

Scotland +40, total 615

Wales +60, total 463

UK + 771 (to be confirmed) total 12878 (needs verification still)

Staff deaths

Supply lines

Very busy, stock sent to LRFs — should be additional drops this week ? exactly when for DAs — likely Friday and Saturday
this week in England

Interim ‘clipper’ supply is up and running but only to a small number of people at present — will take likely 4 weeks until
fully up and running so still reactive work in interim.

There have been some issues with gowns (shortages) and some complications with this e.g. wrong types but this is being
resolved.

There was a body bag shortage but working hard to get increased supply. 8000 today being distributed today.

Social Care
Action Plan being published this afternoon and launched by Secretary of State at Press Conference — details as discussed
in notes yesterday

INQ000395589_0003

Workforce remains a big problem and is part of the action plan

Comms

Launch of social care plan today alongside SoS appearance at 5pm

General comms on differences in data streams and work ongoing on this

General comms on PPE especially in social care sector

Ongoing comms on testing including drive-through sites

John Bell’s report on antibody testing to come out today (oxford university) so reactive lines for that

Best wishes,
Anna

DHSC/PHE/DAs Call 14/4/20 — Brief notes

Apologies if you have already received some notes from Peter but, in case not....
Death data

England — 11005, increase 7744
Scotland — 575, increase of 9

Wales — 403, increase of 19

NI — increase 6

Working UK figure 12107 — increase 778

ONS — NHSE difference in data continues e.g. NHSE figures until 3 April — 5186, ONS 5979 — there is a gap between
them.

— they think that approx 1/3 of the data gap in deaths from community, 1/3 deaths not picked up/tested in hospitals as
COVID, 1/3 related to delay. This continues to be discussed and there is a meeting on this this afternoon. Complicated
problem to unpick.

1 it tl g view. They discussed ides of capturing death i in T these g groups: those
rurses/tloctors/HCWs that happen i in hospital may be picked up through the normal data channels; identifying new
ways to capture wider groups such as pharmacists, NHS office staff, dentists when they die in hospital; HCWs and SCWs
when not dying in hospital. These are all extended and complex groups— will need to work on data sources and verifying
them before can collect/release this data.

NHSE/PHE/DHSC working on this now and will be working with colleagues in DAs.

Wales raised concerns, including regarding accidental identification of people in a small country. Wales advised that they
will be feeding back on this formally but suggested that they would prefer the use of NHS staff as a bracket for all
identified HCWs rather than subcategorising further, as had been suggested. Other DAs also said they are continuing to
review and all agreed that this would continue to be looked at in terms of the best approach going forward.

Adult Social Care © Update

Content in 1 there about i improving a infections control, support for workforce and support for vulnerable groups e.g.
expanding testing, supporting discharges, recruitment, training, support for workforce

Care home deaths from ONS data released today — 217 care home deaths last week (11 day lag so real number will be
much higher). In the 11 days since the 217 figure, approx. doubling in no. of care homes registering a care home
outbreak. Approx. 2100 care homes now registering an outbreak — approx. 14% care homes in England.

Have been requests to include care home deaths in daily data but explained that this is very hard to try and unpick this
data so that this can happen.

Chair queried that, looking at home care, home care deaths also appear up at a greater percentage than care homes and
whether this was significant? DHSC confirmed need for caution when looking at changes in death rates — high
fluctuations in deaths at home anyway (before COVID) depending on many factors. BUT home care sector is under a

huge amount of pressure — very big pressure with staff absences and a lot of other support normally available (e.g.
visiting services, day centres etc) have been scaled back. They are therefore keeping a close eye on this.

Testing

Numbers down again significantly in last report — covers Easter Sunday, therefore not surprising.

Drop in number of patients tested in hospital is more substantial than the number of staff tested. This could be a good
sign and could reflect increased capacity now to bring on more staff (adult social care staff testing now being pushed in
England). Now need to increase demand to fill all the tests now available. Will review numbers again after BH weekend

lag.

Considerable problems with antibody testing. No lateral flow test that passed requirements yet.
Now looking at how could roll out ELISA testing in parallel with looking at antibody testing.

Also ramping up options for population sampling.

Good response to requests for help from industry so far.

Workforce

Numbers of professionals expressing an interest in returning to work increasing.

Also, students getting ready to go onto clinical placements.

However returning staff potentially available in some areas in country not being taken up, perhaps because these areas
are not experiencing the increase in demand for services yet — encouraging them to think mid-term rather than short-
term only and therefore take up the offer of these staff; messenging with employers in these areas.

Also ensuring that support being directed to adult social care sector. Workf
