WITNESS STATEMENT OF DR CHRIS WILLIAMS

i, Christopher Williams care of Public Health Wales, 2 Capital Quarter, Tyndall Street, Cardiff,
CF10 4BZ will say as follows: -

1. This corporate witness statement is provided by me in my capacity as Consultant
Epidemiologist at Public Health Wales in response to a request for evidence made by
the Inquiry Team to Public Health Wales for the disclosure of hospital admission and

hospital inpatient data covering the period 1 February 2020 to 28 June 2022.

2. Public Health Wales has been appointed as a Core Participant for Module 2B.

3. A COVID-19 case is defined (by Public Health Wales) as a person with a positive
SARS-CoV-2 PCR test taken in Wales. COVID-19 cases admitted to hospital are those
admitted to a hospital in Wales for at least one night within 28 days after a positive
SARS-CoV-2 PCR test taken in Wales, or where the patient tested positive in hospital
up to 2 days after admission (where the day of admission is counted as day 1 of an
inpatient stay). All admissions within 28 days after a positive test are counted,
regardless of whether the patient tested positive in the community or during a previous
inpatient stay. For data up to 25 May 2022, one positive test per person within a 42
day period was counted as a case. From 26 May 2022, the de-duplication period
increased to 90 days. The hospital admissions may have been unrelated to the
patients’ SARS-CoV-2 positive test. An evaluation of COVID-19 admissions estimated

using this method found that, compared to diagnoses coded in hospital episode data,

INQ000400585_ 0001

three in every five SARS-CoV-2 positive admissions were given diagnoses consistent
with COVID-19 infection.

COVID-19 cases admitted to intensive care are those admitted to an intensive care
unit in a hospital in Wales for at least one night within 28 days after a positive SARS-
CoV-2 PCR test taken in Wales. Intensive care admissions include COVID-19 cases
likely acquired in the community and in hospital. The intensive care admissions may
have been unrelated to the patients’ SARS-CoV-2 positive test. We do not hold data

on admissions to high dependency units.

PCR test data was extracted from the Public Health Wales Datastore database.
Hospital admissions data was extracted from the hospital patient administrative system
(PAS) via ICNET. Patient and test data has been linked using the patient NHS number.

Residential address used for assignment to deprivation quintile has been extracted
from a live system and may not be the address of the case at the time of their SARS-
CoV-2 test.

Resident population sizes of health boards in Wales have been provided in the
Appendix to support interpretation of counts by health board. Other breakdowns of the
Welsh population have been provided in the accompanying spreadsheet, to support

interpretation of counts by case demographics.

The first recorded COVID-19 case in Wales was confirmed on 27 February 2020 and
therefore ail data is presented from 1 March 2020. Continuous data on admissions is
stored as aggregate weekly counts with weeks running from Monday to Sunday. We
have therefore provided data to the nearest Sunday to the request date - 26 June 2022
rather than 28 June 2022.

9. Over approximately 16 months, there were nearly 24,000 COVID-19 case admissions
to hospitals in Wales. Cwm Taf Morgannwg UHB had the highest number of case
admissions to its hospitals, comprising 21% of total cases admitted. Aneurin Bevan,
Betsi Cadwaladr and Cardiff and Vale University Health Boards (UHB) had similar
numbers of admissions to their hospitals, comprising between 18 and 20% of total case
admissions. Lower numbers of cases were admitted to hospitals in Swansea Bay and

Hywel Dda UHBs, comprising 13% and 9% of total cases admitted respectively.

10. Approximately 2,000 COVID-19 cases were admitted to intensive care in a hospital in
Wales. Cwm Taf Morgannwg UHB had the highest number of cases admitted to its

intensive care units, comprising 22% of total intensive care admissions.

11. The number of cases admitted to the hospitals and the intensive care units in a health
board will be impacted by the size of the population in the catchment area, the
incidence of COVID-19 within that population and the bed capacity of the hospitals and

intensive care units.

12. Case admissions have varied considerably over the 16 month period, with an initial

peak at the end of March 2020, a second peak in late December 2020/early January

2021 and then a series of smaller peaks from Autumn 2021 onwards.

13. Variations in the numbers of case admissions to hospital are influenced by changes in

the underlying incidence of COVID-19 over time, the availability of testing, the severity

of disease associated with different variants, the roll-out of the vaccination campaign

and improvements in community management of the disease.

14. The notch in the chart in autumn 2020 was almost certainly caused by the “fire-break”

intervention from 23 October 2020 to 9 November 2020 (National coronavirus firebreak

to be introduced in Wales on Friday | GOV.WALES).

15. Peaks in intensive care admissions reflect the timing of the peaks in COVID-19 case

hospital admissions. However, the height of the peaks in intensive care admissions

reduced with every wave, reflecting improved patient treatments and management and

widespread vaccine roll out, resulting in better patient outcomes and reduced

requirement for intensive care support.

16. Whilst there were some small differences in the timing of the peaks in case admissions
by health board, broadly, all health boards experienced peaks at the same time. Case
admissions to Hywel Dda UHB were consistently lower over all waves. Cwm Taf
Morgannwg UHB had the highest number of case admissions to its hospitals in wave
2 and early in Autumn 2021, but subsequently higher case admissions were observed
in Betsi Cadwaladr UHB. There were larger differences in health board case

admissions in wave 2, compared to the subsequent waves.

17. Small numbers of weekly intensive case admissions make data difficult to interpret,
particularly after the first two waves. Betsi Cadwaladr and particularly Hywel Dda UHBs
had comparatively fewer admissions to their intensive care units in the first wave than
the other major health boards. Within wave 2, admissions to intensive care in Cwm Taf
Morgannwg UHB were consistently higher than to those in other health boards from

September to December 2021, followed by Betsi Cadwaladr UHB peaking in January.

18. Within the 20 year age categories, the highest number of cases admitted to hospital

was in those aged 60-79 years, comprising more than a third of all admitted cases.

INQ000400585_0007

19.

The fewest case admissions were in the 0-19 age group, comprising 6% of total cases
admitted to hospital. The highest number of cases admitted to intensive care was also
in the 60-79 age group, comprising 45% of total intensive care admissions. The highest
proportion of admissions admitted to intensive care was in the 40-59 age group, at
17% of case admissions in that age group. Three percent of cases admitted to

intensive care were in the 80+ age group.

In addition to the influences mentioned in earlier sections, the distribution of hospital
and intensive care admissions by age group will also be influenced by the age
distribution of the underlying population. For intensive care admissions, reduced
numbers of cases admitted in the oldest age groups may not indicate less severe
disease in this group, but a reduced ability to benefit from intensive care support. This
is due in turn to the overall more severe outcome profile in older age groups mediated
partly by age and partly by co-morbidities and other factors associated with increasing

age.

24. Over time, there have consistently been more male cases admitted to intensive care
than female. The difference between the sexes was particularly noticeable in the first
two waves. Most of the reduction of cases admitted to intensive care observed in the
wave in Autumn 2021 was as a result of a reduction of male cases admitted to intensive

care in Wales.

25. The Welsh Index of Multiple Deprivation (WIMD) is the Welsh Government's official

measure of relative deprivation for small areas in Wales. It identifies areas with the

a

INQ000400585_0012

highest concentrations of several different types of deprivation. WIMD ranks ail small
areas in Wales from 1 (most deprived) to 1,909 (least deprived). It is a National Statistic
produced by statisticians at the Welsh Government (Index of Multiple Deprivation
(gov.wales)). Seventy-nine per cent of the cases admitted to hospital and 78% of cases
admitted to intensive care could be assigned to a deprivation quintile. Amongst those
that could be assigned, numbers of case admissions increased as deprivation
increased with 26% of case admissions residing in the most deprived quintile
compared to 15% residing in the least deprived quintile. A similar pattern was observed
in intensive care case admissions, although the difference in percentage points
between the highest and lowest quintile was larger, with 27% of intensive care case
admissions residing in the most deprived quintile compared to 13% in the least

deprived quintile.

26. Within each deprivation quintile, a similar percentage of case admissions to hospital
were admitted to intensive care, but the highest percentage was observed in the most
deprived quintile at 8.7% and the lowest percentage in the least deprived quintile at
7.6%.

27.\In Wales, a COVID-19 hospital inpatient is defined as a person in a hospital in Wales
on a Sunday who has spent at least one night in hospital and has had a positive SARS-
CoV-2 PCR test taken in Wales in the previous 28 days. The reasons for the inpatient
stays may be unrelated to the patients’ positive SARS-CoV-2 test. Cases may include
patients who have acquired their infection in the hospital. This count refers to a ‘point
prevalence’ survey of inpatients i.e. only capturing those actually in beds on that day.
People may be admitted and discharged between these points (these would be
captured in the admissions data) but overall, the picture on any given day (e.g. Sunday)
reflects what is likely to be present through the rest of the week, subject to weekly

rhythms around admission and discharges.

28. A COVID-19 intensive care inpatient is defined as a person in an intensive care unit in
a hospital in Wales on a Sunday who has spent at least one night in intensive care and
has had a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test taken in Wales in the previous 28 days. The
reasons for the intensive care stays may be unrelated to the patients’ positive SARS-

CoV-2 test. The data does not include inpatients in high dependency units.

13

INQ000400585_0013

29.PCR test data was extracted from the Public Health Wales Datastore database.
Hospital inpatient data was extracted from the hospital patient administrative system

(PAS) via ICNET. Patient and test data has been linked using the patient NHS number.
30. The first recorded COVID-19 case in Wales was confirmed on 27 February 2020 and
therefore ail data is presented from 1 March 2020. Continuous data on admissions is

stored as aggregate weekly counts with weeks running from Monday to Sunday. We

have therefore provided data to the nearest Sunday to the request date — 26 June
2022 rather than 28 June 2022.

31. The COVID-19 inpatient trends are very similar to those for the COVID-19 case
15

admissions in terms of timing. The highest number of COVID-19 inpatients was in
[INTENTIONAL SPACE]

Winter 2020/21, with approximately 2,000 inpatient cases. The later peaks in inpatients
from Autumn 2021 onwards increased in magnitude with each wave. This likely
reflected increased incidence in the community as a result of the Omicron variant, but
also may reflect high levels of screening in hospitals for early identification of
asymptomatic cases, and increased transmissibility of Omicron in hospital settings.

32. Trends in intensive care COVID-19 inpatients followed general COVID-19 inpatient

numbers in terms of timing. The largest number of COVID-19 intensive care inpatients

was in April 2020 and January 2021 at approximately 100 intensive care inpatient

cases on a single day. There was a large decrease in intensive care COVID-19

inpatients between Wave 2 and subsequent waves and numbers have generally been

on a decreasing trend since November 2021.

33. There were some small differences between health boards in the timing of the peaks.
The highest number of COVID-19 inpatients was in Cwm Taf Morgannwg UHB in
Winter 2020/21, with more than 500 patients in the hospitals within that health board
in a single week and approximately double the number than was in Hywel Dda UHB at
the same time. In later waves, COVID-19 inpatient numbers were relatively similar
between the larger health boards, with the exception of Betsi Cadwaladr UHB in

January and April 2022 where there were considerably higher numbers of COVID-19
inpatients.

34. In the first wave, highest numbers of COVID-19 intensive care inpatients were in

Cardiff and Vale, Aneurin Bevan and Swansea Bay UHBs, with approximately 25

patients each in a single week. Similar peaks in counts were experienced in Cwm Taf
Morgannwg, Cardiff and Vale and Betsi Cadwaladr UHBs in Winter 2020/21. Numbers
of intensive care inpatient cases were much lower in all health boards in the peaks

following wave 2.

35. Whilst cases admitted were consistently highest in the 60-79 age group, inpatient

cases were consistently highest in the 80+ age group. In one week in January 2021,
there were approximately 900 COVID-19 inpatients aged 80 years or older in Welsh
hospitals. The peaks in inpatients in all waves were largely composed of inpatients in
the two oldest age groups (60-79 and 80+), which may reflect the likely longer lengths
of stay of more elderly patients and screening of these patients within hospital. There

was a small increase in inpatients in the youngest age group over time.

38. Over the first two waves there were markedly more male COVID-19 hospital inpatients
than female. In the later waves numbers of both male and female COVID-19 inpatients

reduced and the difference between them decreased.

39. Data available does not enable analysis by other protected characteristics, as ethnicity
data is very poorly completed (<40%) and vulnerabilities are also not included in the
dataset. A breakdown by index of multiple deprivation is possible but would require a
large amount of new analysis, as the dataset is a series of point prevalence data on
current inpatients each Sunday — this would need to be aggregated and then linked to

the deprivation by postcode.
